High volume limestone alkali-activated cement developed by design of experiment
Abstract:
Herein, we report on the development of a cement comprising ground granulated blast furnace slag, soda ash (sodium carbonate), and up to 68wt.% granular limestone. Mixture Design of Experiment (DOE) was utilized, with analysis of compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, hydraulic properties, cost, CO2 production, and energy consumption. Models were derived to understand the impact of mix design on performance and for optimization. Successful formulations are hydraulic and cure at room temperature, with strengths as high as 41MPa at 3d and 65MPa at 28d. These formulations, compared to OPC, are competitive in cost and performance and can reduce both CO2 production and energy consumption by up to 97%.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'limestone', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'limestone'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'geopolymer', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'alkali-activated cement'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': {'limestone percentage': {'value': 'up to 68wt.%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'up to 68wt.% granular limestone'}}}}, {'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'blast furnace slag', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'ground granulated blast furnace slag'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'geopolymer', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'alkali-activated cement'}, 'material_preparation': {'methods': [{'value': 'grinding', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'ground granulated blast furnace slag'}]}, 'mix_design': None}}, {'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'soda ash', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'soda ash (sodium carbonate)'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'geopolymer', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'alkali-activated cement'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': None}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'cement paste', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'development of a cement'}, 'properties': {'strength': {'value': 'as high as 41MPa at 3d and 65MPa at 28d', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'with strengths as high as 41MPa at 3d and 65MPa at 28d'}, 'CO2 production': {'value': 'reduced by up to 97%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'can reduce both CO2 production and energy consumption by up to 97%'}, 'energy consumption': {'value': 'reduced by up to 97%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'can reduce both CO2 production and energy consumption by up to 97%'}}}}]"

A preliminary study of manufacture of cement from rice husk ash
Abstract:
Cement has been successfully produced from the agricultural waste, rice husk ash. For this production, rice husk was pre-carbonized in a pilot-plant and was further decarbonized in an electric furnace to produce rice husk ash. 24.5% rice husk ash was mixed with other raw materials (sourced locally) for producing white Portland cement and the cement produced was used to make a concrete slab. The formulated cement slab, commercial cement and slab were tested for their physical characteristics and chemical composition. The results of tests confirmed that produced cement was of similar standard to commercial cement. Based on the results, the production of cement from rice husk has been recommended for developing countries since it would help reduce problems of rice husks as farm wastes.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'rice husk ash', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'rice husk ash'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'clinker feedstock', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'manufacture of cement'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': {'rice husk ratio': {'value': '24.5%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': '24.5% rice husk ash'}}}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'cement', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'manufacture of cement'}, 'properties': None}}]"

Accelerating effects of colloidal nano-silica for beneficial calcium–silicate–hydrate formation in cement
Abstract:
The hydration process of Ca3SiO5 (C3S) cement is investigated, and accelerating effects of adding colloidal silica (CS) are established. CS accelerates dissolution of the C3S phase, and renders a more rapid formation of the calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) binding phase. The role of water is demonstrated. Water evaporation correlates with the appearance of a sharp IR band at 3650 cm−1 signifying non-hydrogen bonded OH groups. Incomplete hydration results in Ca(OH)2 precipitation. Suppression of water evaporation causes the 3650 cm−1 band to vanish. The Ca2+ ions become incorporated in the C–S–H network, the formation of which is accelerated by CS.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'colloidal nano-silica', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'colloidal nano-silica'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'calcium–silicate–hydrate formation in cement'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': None}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'C-S-H binding phase', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) binding phase'}, 'properties': None}}]"

Characteristics of Australian brown coal fly ash blended geopolymers
Abstract:
AbstractThe present study evaluates the potential re-use options for a suite of low rank brown coal fly ashes (ASTM class C fly ash) as feedstock for geopolymer binder synthesis. Ash suitability was evaluated using a number of conventional characterisation tools including XRF, calorimetric and microscopy to analyse solid phase distribution in relation to compositional differences derived from ternary diagram analogues. Blends of brown coal ash with selected black coal fly ash (class F) and blast furnace slag were developed for compressive strength and durability tests. The study show that brown coal fly ash with higher Al content improved the rate of reaction of blended binders and that observed high contents of sulphate and magnesium oxides available in some brown coal fly ashes induced accelerated decomposition in high moist environments. Overall, it was evident from both microscopy and mineralogical analysis of binder mixtures that brown coal fly ash participate in geopolymer network formation rather than act as filler material. Factors influencing brown coal ash reactivity and the potential for incorporating this class of ash in developing stable and usable geopolymer binder systems are discussed.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'Class C fly ash', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'brown coal fly ashes (ASTM class C fly ash)'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'geopolymer', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'geopolymers'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': None}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'geopolymer paste', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'geopolymer binder systems'}, 'properties': None}}]"

Effect of s, fly ash and limestone powder on preplaced aggregate concrete mechanical properties and reinforced beam shear capacity
Abstract:
A laboratory investigation on the effect of s, fly ash, and limestone powder on mechanical properties of preplaced aggregate concrete (PAC) and shear strength of reinforced PAC beams without stirrups was conducted. S, fly ash and limestone powder is varied in each mixture to show their effects on the mechanical and structural strength properties of PAC. Ten reinforced PAC beams were cast, with PAC compressive strength ranging from 9.7MPa to 35.8MPa. From the same mix proportions, PAC slab members were cast to show an example application of PAC in the precast concrete industry. Beams were load tested in a four-point loading configuration with shear span to depth ratio (a/d) of 2.5, while slabs were loaded in equal 1/3 points. Load bearing performances of beams were evaluated based on load at first flexural cracking and ultimate shear load capacity. It was found that sand reduces workability of PAC grouts, but could be compensated by adding fly ash, while no significant fresh property effects were observed when cement was replaced with limestone powder. PAC mechanical strength had been shown to decrease as more cement was replaced with limestone powder. Modulus of rupture and ultimate shear strength of PAC beam members without stirrups can be designed using ACI 318-14 provisions. Finite element simulation using Vector2 can predict the ultimate shear strength of beam members. PAC example application through PAC slab members has shown similar performance at a lower concrete cost.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'limestone powder', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'limestone powder'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'cement was replaced with limestone powder'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': None}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'concrete', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'concrete'}, 'properties': None}}]"

Transport properties of high-volume fly ash concrete: Capillary water sorption, water sorption under vacuum and gas permeability
Abstract:
Studying concrete’s resistance to carbonation-induced corrosion usually involves exposing the material to CO2 for quite some time. To estimate the performance of high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete more quickly, two key properties governing this process can be studied, namely water penetrability and gas permeability. With respect to HVFA mixtures optimized for usage in an environment exposed to carbonation with wetting and drying, we adopted the latter approach. This paper presents a full assessment of concrete mixtures with varying fly ash amounts. A 50% fly ash mixture by mass with a binder content of 400 kg/m3 and a water-to-binder ratio of 0.4 had a lower capillary water uptake (−32.6%), water sorption under vacuum (−10.7%) and gas permeability (−78.9%) than a proper reference normally used in this environment. The fly ash applied had an excellent quality regarding loss on ignition (3.5%) and fineness (19% retained on a 45 μm sieve).","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'coal fly ash', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'fly ash'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'with a binder content'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': {'fly ash ratio': {'value': '50%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': '50% fly ash mixture by mass'}, 'water-to-binder ratio': {'value': '0.4', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'a water-to- binder ratio of 0.4'}}}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'concrete', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'concrete'}, 'properties': {'capillary water uptake': {'value': '−32.6%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'a lower capillary water uptake (−32.6%)'}, 'water sorption under vacuum': {'value': '−10.7%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'water sorption under vacuum (−10.7%)'}, 'gas permeability': {'value': '−78.9%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'gas permeability (−78.9%)'}}}}]"

Strength and durability characteristics of copper tailing concrete
Abstract:
Solid waste disposal is a worldwide problem. If not properly disposed, these materials become sources of environmental pollution and the problems related to it. Various studies are done worldwide to dispose these solid waste materials by using them for partial or complete replacement of aggregates in cement concrete. Copper tailing is the solid waste material left during the purification of the precious copper from the copper ores. Disposal of these waste tailings are very essential as it destroys the ecological environment. This paper investigates the suitability of copper tailing in cement concrete as a partial replacement of natural river sand. M25 grade of concrete is designed as per IS:10262-2010, with water/cement ratios of 0.4, 0.45 and 0.5. 0% to 60% substitution of fine aggregates was done with copper tailings. The specimens with 0% copper tailing was taken as control mix. Tests were done to determine the compressive strength, flexural strength, pull-off strength, abrasion resistance, drying shrinkage, air and water permeability, rapid chloride permeability, alkalinity and resistance to sulphate attack in concrete specimens. It was observed that Copper tailing may be utilised for the partial replacement for natural fine aggregates till 60% replacement, with water-cement ratios 0.4, 0.45 and 0.50. As the copper tailing concrete (up to 60% substitution) exhibited good strength and durability characteristics, it may be recommended for all construction activities.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'copper tailing', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'copper tailing'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'fine aggregate', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': '0% to 60% substitution of fine aggregates '}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': {'water/cement ratio': {'value': '0.4, 0.45, 0.5', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'water/cement ratios of 0.4, 0.45 and 0.5'}, 'fine aggregate substitution ratio': {'value': '0 - 60%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': '0% to 60% substitution of fine aggregates'}}}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'concrete ', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'concrete'}, 'properties': {'strength': {'value': 'good with up to 60% substitution of fine aggregates by copper tailing', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'the copper tailing concrete (up to 60% substitution) exhibited good strength and durability characteristics'}, 'durability': {'value': 'good with up to 60% substitution of fine aggregates by copper tailing', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'the copper tailing concrete (up to 60% substitution) exhibited good strength and durability characteristics'}}}}]"

The effect of limestone microfilier replacement of cement on the mechanical performance and cost effectiveness of low ratio superplasticized portland cement mortars was investigated. The experiments were designed based on a so-called uniform-precision factorial plan. Cement pastes of different ratios and incorporating various proportions of limestone powder and/or silica fume were designed to have a constant flow time. Mortars corresponding to the different cement pastes were made, their 1, 3, 7, 28 and 91 day compressive strengths were measured and their cost effectiveness was analyzed. The statistical approach used permitted the calculation of the isoresponse curves for the parameters under study over the experimental domain and the optimization of their effect.","[{'material': {'mat_name': [{'value': 'limestone powder', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'limestone powder'}, {'value': 'silica fume', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'silica fume'}]}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'replacement of cement'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': None}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'cement mortar', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'cement mortars'}, 'properties': None}}]"

In this work, a method for incorporating fly ash in constructional technology was developed by production of boroaluminosilicate geopolymers. These new class of geopolymers were appropriately synthesized from mixtures of fly ash and anhydrous borax and compressive strengths as high as 64MPa were achieved by using suitable amount of borax. Different types of microstructures were observed by changing mixture proportion of the specimens. All of specimens revealed a brittle fracture with no crack branching in the mixture. Additionally, less unreacted fly ash particle was observed in the considered pastes indicating a totally different fracture mechanism in boroaluminosilicate geopolymers than aluminosilicate ones. FT-IR analyses of the mixtures revealed an additional B-O bond in comparison with aluminosilicate geopolymers. It was shown that this bond is a key factor to determine compressive strength and specimens with no B-O bond have lower strengths.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'fly ash', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'fly ash'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'geopolymer', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'geopolymer'}, 'material_preparation': {'methods': [{'value': 'mixing with anhydrous borax', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'These new class of geopolymers were appropriately synthesized from mixtures of fly ash and anhydrous borax'}]}, 'mix_design': None}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'geopolymer paste', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'pastes'}, 'properties': {'compressive strength': {'value': 'as high as 64MPa', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'compressive strengths as high as 64MPa'}}}}]"

Kinetics of fly ash geopolymerization
Abstract:
Based on the wet chemical analysis, we measured and modeled the kinetics of reactions between fly ash and KOH at various temperatures and water-to-solid mass ratios (W/S). We find that three consecutive rate-limiting processes control reaction progress: (1) dissolution or alteration of the glass phase in the fly ash, (2) classical Fick diffusion through a surface layer, and (3) diffusive transport through a more complex gel structure (interstitial gel). This sequence of processes is independent of W/S (0.35-40), temperature (22-75 degC), and KOH concentration (5-10 M). The relative contribution of each process to the overall reaction progress changes with experimental conditions. Only if and when the third process is rate limiting, a fly ash geopolymer forms and develops mechanical strength (sufficiently low W/S ratio provided). The rate of reaction progress decreases significantly, due to slow transport of reacting species to the surface of the glass particles.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'coal fly ash', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'fly ash'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'geopolymer', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'geopolymerization'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': {'KOH concentration': {'value': '5-10 M', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'KOH concentration (5-10 M)'}, 'W/S': {'value': '0.35-40', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'W/S (0.35-40)'}}}}]"

Prediction of properties of self-compacting concrete containing fly ash using artificial neural network
Abstract:
This paper investigates the feasibility of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) modeling to predict the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) containing fly ash as cement replacement. For the purpose of constructing this model, a database of experimental data was gathered from the literature and used for training and testing the model. The data used in the artificial neural network model are arranged in a format of six input parameters that cover the total binder content, fly ash replacement percentage, water-binder ratio, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates and superplasticizer. Four outputs parameters are predicted based on the ANN technique as the slump flow, the L-box ratio, the V-funnel time and the compressive strength at 28 days of SCC. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed model and improve its performance, a comparison of the ANN-based prediction model with other researcher's experimental results was carried out, and a good agreement was found. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted using the trained and tested ANN model to investigate the effect of fly ash on SCC properties. This study shows that artificial neural network has strong potential as a feasible tool for predicting accurately the properties of SCC containing fly ash.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'coal fly ash', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'fly ash'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'as cement replacement'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': None}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'self-compacting concrete', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'self-compacting concrete'}, 'properties': None}}]"

Heat of hydration of Portland high-calcium fly ash cement incorporating limestone powder: Effect of limestone particle size
Abstract:
This study investigated the limestone powder (LS) particle size effect on the heat of hydration of Portland cement (PC) and high-calcium fly ash (FA) systems. The LS used has a maximum particle size of 5 and 20 μm, respectively. Isothermal calorimetry was used to measure the heat evolution during the hydration process of the cement and PC–FA pastes. The results show the particle size of LS had a significant influence on the observed heat of hydration both on rate of reaction and total amount of heat release. The hydration rates of both PC–LS and PC–FA–LS systems were accelerated by 5 μm LS, while 20 μm LS did not. For PC–FA–LS system, the total heat release at 48 h when using 5 μm LS were higher than FA at 30% replacement level whereas 20 μm LS showed similar total heat release. However, the total heat release of these ternary mixtures with both LS particle sizes was still lower than PC control. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis were applied to identify the hydration products. XRD results show the formation of carboaluminates and ettringite was still found at 28 days, indicated the stabilization of ettringite when both LS particle size were used. The reaction between LS and PC or FA was confirmed by TG results in the reduction of CaCO3 content.","[{'material': {'mat_name': [{'value': 'Class C fly ash', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'high-calcium fly ash'}, {'value': 'limestone powder', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'limestone powder'}]}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'PC-FA pastes'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': None}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'cement paste', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'PC-FA pastes'}, 'properties': None}}]"

Effect of chemical composition of slag on chloride penetration resistance of concrete
Abstract:
Three ground granulated slags (FeMn arc-furnace (GGAS), Corex (GGCS) and blastfurnace (GGBS) slags) of varying chemical composition, and from different sources were used to make concretes using two w/b ratios (0.40 and 0.60) and three slag replacement levels (20%, 35% and 50%). The effect of chemical composition and replacement level of slags on the chloride penetration resistance of the concretes was assessed using the chloride conductivity test. The results showed that the chloride penetration resistance of concrete increases with decreasing w/b ratio and increasing slag replacement level. In the GGAS concretes, despite having relatively low SiO2 and high MgO content, its significantly high Mn2O3 and low Al2O3 content was found to have a negative effect on the chloride penetration resistance of the concrete. The significantly high chloride penetration resistance of GGCS concretes was partly attributed to both its high CaO content and particle fineness. Only GGCS concretes showed a trend of increasing chloride penetration resistance with increased particle fineness; GGBS and GGAS concretes did not show any trend between particle fineness and chloride penetration resistance. The slag activity index was found to be a better indicator of chloride penetration resistance in concrete than the slag hydraulic index.","[{'material': {'mat_name': [{'value': 'FeMn arc-furnace slag', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'FeMn arc-furnace (GGAS)'}, {'value': 'Corex slag', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'Corex (GGCS)'}, {'value': 'blast furnace slag', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'blastfurnace (GGBS) slags'}]}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': ['ground granulated slags', 'w/b ratios']}, 'material_preparation': {'methods': [{'value': 'grinding', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'ground granulated slags'}]}, 'mix_design': {'w/b ratio': {'value': '0.40 and 0.60', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'w/b ratios (0.40 and 0.60)'}, 'slag replacement level': {'value': '20%, 35% and 50%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'slag replacement levels (20%, 35% and 50%)'}}}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'concrete', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'concrete'}, 'properties': {'chloride penetration resistance': {'value': 'increases with decreasing w/b ratio and increasing slag replacement level', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'chloride penetration resistance of concrete increases with decreasing w/b ratio and increasing slag replacement level'}}}}]"

SCBA and RHA were produced using vibratory grinding in dry open circuit and conventional and high-performance concretes were produced with 0% and 20% of both ashes as cement replacement (by mass). Ternary mixtures containing cement, SCBA and RHA (0.6–0.2–0.2) were also produced in order to study the benefits of the simultaneous use of both ultrafine ashes on concrete properties. Experiments were performed to investigate the rheology (yield stress and plastic viscosity), compressive strength (at 7, 28, 90, and 180days), Young’s modulus (at 28days) and rapid chloride-ion penetrability. The pore size distribution and adiabatic temperature rise of the reference and ternary mixtures were also evaluated. The joint influence of both ashes allowed reaching positive effects in rheology and kept constant or increased the compressive strength when compared to the reference mixtures. Moreover, the ternary concretes presented lower electric charges and the replacement of cement by 40% SCBA and RHA decreased significantly the maximum adiabatic temperature rise of conventional concrete.","[{'material': {'mat_name': [{'value': 'rice husk ash', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'RHA'}, {'value': 'sugar cane bagasse ash', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'SCBA'}]}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'with 0% and 20% of both ashes as cement replacement (by mass)'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': {'cement replacement ratio': {'value': '20% for both ashes', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'with 0% and 20% of both ashes as cement replacement (by mass)'}}}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'concrete', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'concretes'}, 'properties': None}}]"

Performance of self-compacting concrete containing fly ash
Abstract:
The influence of including fly ash (FA) on the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) is investigated. Portland cement (PC) was partially replaced with 0-80% FA. The water to binder ratio was maintained at 0.36 for all mixes. Properties included workability, compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (V), absorption and shrinkage. The results indicate that high volume FA can be used in SCC to produce high strength and low shrinkage. Replacing 40% of PC with FA resulted in a strength of more than 65N/mm2at 56days. High absorption values are obtained with increasing amount of FA, however, all FA concrete exhibits absorption of less than 2%. There is a systematic reduction in shrinkage as the FA content increases and at 80% FA content, the shrinkage at 56days reduced by two third compared with the control. A linear relationship exists between the 56 day shrinkage and FA content. Increasing the admixture content beyond a certain level leads to a reduction in strength and increase in absorption. The correlation between strength and absorption indicates that there is sharp decrease in strength as absorption increases from 1 to 2%. After 2% absorption, the strength reduces at a much slower rate.","[{'material': {'mat_name': {'value': 'coal fly ash', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'fly ash'}}, 'application': {'app_name': {'value': 'supplementary cementitious material', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'Portland cement (PC) was partially replaced with 0-80% FA'}, 'material_preparation': None, 'mix_design': {'PC replacement ratio': {'value': '0 - 80%', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'Portland cement (PC) was partially replaced with 0-80% FA'}, 'water to binder ratio': {'value': '0.36', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'water to binder ratio was maintained at 0.36 for all mixes'}}}}, {'product': {'prod_name': {'value': 'self-compacting concrete', 'section': 'title', 'text': 'self-compacting concrete'}, 'properties': {'strength': {'value': 'high volume FA can produce high strength, more than 65N/mm2 at 56days with 40% FA ratio', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': ['The results indicate that high volume FA can be used in SCC to produce high strength and low shrinkage', 'Replacing 40% of PC with FA resulted in a strength of more than 65N/mm2at 56days']}, 'shrinkage': {'value': 'high volume FA can produce low shrinkage, a systematic reduction as the FA content increases', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': ['The results indicate that high volume FA can be used in SCC to produce high strength and low shrinkage', 'a systematic reduction in shrinkage as the FA content increases']}, 'absorption': {'value': 'hihg values with increasing amount of FA, less than 2% for all FA concretes', 'section': 'abstract', 'text': 'High absorption values are obtained with increasing amount of FA, however, all FA concrete exhibits absorption of less than 2%'}}}}]"
