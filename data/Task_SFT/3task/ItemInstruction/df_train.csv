Title:
Durability of very high volume fly ash cement pastes and mortars in aggressive solutions
Abstract:
The resistance of very high volume fly ash cement pastes and mortars activated by Na2SO4 has been monitored following immersion for up to 90d in 0.1M HCl, 4.4% Na2SO4 and ASTM-compliant sea water. Changes in the compressive strengths of mortars and in crystalline phases, bond environments, and the microstructure of pastes following immersion were monitored. Experiments were repeated with a commercially available sulfate resistant cement. Both cements were found to present adequate resistance to both sea water and the Na2SO4 solution. However, both were severely degraded by acid immersion. Differences in potential degradation mechanisms based on the chemistry of the fly ash binder and the reference cement are discussed.",['coal fly ash']

Title:
Studies on concrete containing ground waste glass
Abstract:
The possibility of using finely ground waste glass as partial cement replacement in concrete was examined through three sets of tests: the lime-glass tests to assess the pozzolanic activity of ground glass, the compressive strength tests of concrete having 30% cement replaced by ground glass to monitor the strength development, and the mortar bar tests to study the potential expansion. The results showed that ground glass having a particle size finer than 38 Î¼m did exhibit a pozzolanic behavior. The compressive strength from lime-glass tests exceeded a threshold value of 4.1 MPa. The strength activity index was 91, 84, 96, and 108% at 3, 7, 28, and 90 days, respectively, exceeding 75% at all ages. The mortar bar tests demonstrated that the finely ground glass helped reduce the expansion by up to 50%. A size effect was observed; a smaller glass particle size led to a higher reactivity with lime, a higher compressive strength in concrete, and a lower expansion. Compared to fly ash concrete, concrete containing ground glass exhibited a higher strength at both early and late ages.",['waste glass']

Title:
Influence of the initial water content in flash calcined metakaolin-based geopolymer
Abstract:
This study assesses the influence of the initial amount of water in metakaolin-based geopolymer on some of its properties in the hardened state. Results suggest a linearly decreasing influence of the amount of water on the mechanical performance of the geopolymer and showed that the majority of this water was not bonded to the structure. Moreover, it was found that whatever the amount of water initially introduced, all the samples contained the same amount of water after a drying period. The study of the porous network showed a large pore volume of 50% of the total volume which corresponds to the volume of water initially introduced. Finally, the observation of numerous macropore helped to explain the high transfer coefficients measured on the geopolymer.",['metakaolin']

Physical, chemical and mechanical properties of fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue (FC3R) blended cements
Abstract:
The use of fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue (FC3R) as a cement replacement material has been studied. Four FC3R-blended cements were prepared by the replacement of Portland cement by FC3R in the 6-20% range by mass. Chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the FC3R-blended cements were compared to those of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Chemical and mechanical tests suggested important pozzolanic activity of FC3R-replacing material. An increase in the compressive strength of the FC3R-blended cements was observed, yielding equal or greater compressive strength than mortars prepared with OPC.",['fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue']

Title:
Influence and mechanism of micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of concrete
Abstract:
The abrasion resistances of concrete in which the cement was partially replaced by 40 wt% super fine slag (SFS), 5 wt% nano-SiO2 (NS), 5 wt% NS and 25 wt% fly ash (FA) were tested. Mechanisms responsible for the affection of these micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of the concrete were analyzed through measurements of the micro-hardness of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of the aggregate-cement matrix and the cement matrix, the hydration products of the paste, and the degree of polymerization of the silicate chains of C-S-H in the paste. Results indicated that the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA improved the abrasion resistance of the surface mortar layer by 82%, 73% and 68%, respectively, and that of the concrete by 20%, 16% and 13%, respectively. Because of the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA, Ca(OH)2 was consumed to produce more calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and other aluminiferous hydration products, and the degree of polymerization of silicate chains in C-S-H was increased. Therefore, the micro-mechanical properties of the ITZ and the cement matrix were strengthened, improving the abrasion resistance of the concrete.","['blast furnace slag', 'SiO2 nanoparticle', 'SiO2 nanoparticle', 'coal fly ash']"

Title:
Effects of crushed glass cullet sizes, casting methods and pozzolanic materials on ASR of concrete blocks
Abstract:
The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of using different particle sizes of recycled glass, casting methods and pozzolanic materials in reducing the expansion due to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) of concrete blocks prepared with the use of crushed glass as fine aggregate. In this work, 25x25x285mm mortar bar specimens were prepared using conventional wet-mixed and dry-mixed methods. Except for the control mortar bar, all the specimens were prepared by completely replacing river sand with different particle sizes of recycled glass. In addition, the influence of fly ash (PFA) and metakaolin (MK) content on the reduction of ASR expansion was also investigated. The flexural strength of the mortar bar specimens before and after they had been exposed to 1N NaOH solution was determined to complement the results of ASR expansion test. SEM was performed to examine the microstructure as well as nature of the cement binder-glass interfacial zone. The results reveal that ASR expansion reduced with reducing particle size of glass used. For the same given mix proportion, the dry-mixed method resulted in 44% less expansion when compared with the wet-mixed method. Both PFA and MK were demonstrated to be able to significantly reduce ASR expansion of the concrete glass blocks.",['waste glass']

Title:
Effects of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin on the morphology and mechanical properties of metakaolin-based geopolymer
Abstract:
Natural fiber-reinforced geopolymer has attracted wide attention in construction and building materials due to its low cost, low density, and excellent mechanical properties. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three basic components of natural fibres, and were investigated to reveal their influence on the metakaolin-based geopolymer. Comparative evaluations were investigated via morphology analysis and mechanical strength analysis. The results showed distinct microstructures and mechanical properties of the geopolymer-based materials with cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively. A low content (5 wt%) of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose enhanced the flexural and compressive strength of pure geopolymer. Higher lignin and hemicellulose led to the porous morphology, lower density, and brittle fractures of geopolymer-based composites, which reduced the flexural and compressive strength in these geopolymer-based composites. It was noted that the degree of geopolymerization was clearly lowered by the alkaline degradation of hemicellulose. With the increase in cellulose content, in contrast, the denser structure and fewer pores of the geopolymer matrix were detected, as well as ductile failures of geopolymer-based composites. Good bonding was also shown between the geopolymer matrix and cellulose fibres without remarkable degradation. The results of this study will facilitate a better understanding of the effect of lignocellulosic biomass in natural fibre-reinforced geopolymers and should serve as the basis for further research and applications.","['cellulose', 'hemicellulose', 'lignin', 'metakaolin']"

Title:
Preparation of the saving-energy sulphoaluminate cement using MSWI fly ash
Abstract:
MSWI fly ash was used as a major cement raw material in sintering sulphoaluminate cement clinker successfully in the laboratory. Sintering system, mechanical performance, hydration process and microstructure of the clinker was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), etc. The result shows that the clinker can be sintered properly under the temperature of 1200-1300 degC and sintered time of 120 min. Cl- content in the clinker made with MSWI fly ash is about 1.08%. However most Cl- cannot leach out in water solution from the hardened cement paste during curing age between 1 d and 28 d because of the Cl- being combined in clinker minerals and its hydrates. The compressive strength of the sulphoaluminate cement was high in early age while that developed smoothly in later age.",['MSWI fly ash']

Title:
A review on different methods of activating tailings to improve their cementitious property as cemented paste and reusability
Abstract:
Over the past few decades, as demand for minerals and metals has increased, the amount and volume of wastes and tailings has also increased dramatically. The management and reuse of mineral wastes and tailings not only help protect the environment but also are properly associated with economic benefits. As a result, mineral processing wastes disposal and storage has become a global issue. Along with the use of cemented paste as a backfill in underground spaces, the use of mineral processing wastes in the construction industry or as a substitute for cement is one of the new approaches to mineral tailings management. It is worth noting that the cement industry is facing crucial environmental issues. Portland cement production in industries increases the greenhouse effect and creates acidic rain. In fact, it generates greenhouse gases directly through carbon dioxide emission during clinker production as well as through energy consumption. In addition, the increasing stringency of environmental regulations has forced the mining industries to make efforts in order to manage tailings. One of the new and attractive techniques to reduce environmental problems and to obtain economic and technological benefits is to increase the use of tailings, for example, the use of mineral tailings as a substitute for cement. It is important to note that mineral tailings are not normally cemented and are accompanied by reduced strength of cement and concrete mortars; thus, there is a need for methods to increase their cementitious properties. Activation is one of the methods improving cementitious/pozzolanic properties of mineral tailings. Therefore, the present review study aimed to investigate the activation methods to improve the properties of tailings resulted from minerals processing in order to be used as a replacement for cement, to reduce the pollution caused by cement production, as well as to reduce the volume of unused mineral tailings. Different physical, chemical, and thermal activation methods were examined, and criticisms and research gaps of previous studies were presented.",['mine tailings']

Title:
Experimental investigation of the effect of silica fume on the thermal spalling of reactive powder concrete
Abstract:
The distinct spalling performances of reactive powder concrete (RPC) specimens with various silica fume (SF) contents exposed to high temperatures were observed via high-resolution photography. The RPC microstructures and pore structures after high-temperature exposure were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results provide experimental evidence of the high-temperature spalling mechanism of RPC. Increasing the SF content in RPC increases its compressive strength and compactness, offering greater mitigation of devastating spalling behaviour, but also producing more pulverized spalling remnants. This is attributed to the post-heating cracked microstructure and refined pores, which promote localized rather than entirely explosive spalling.",['silica fume']

Title:
Characterization of palm oil clinker powder for utilization in cement-based applications
Abstract:
Palm oil clinker (POC) is a waste material produced as result of using palm oil shell and mesocarp fibers as fuel to run stream turbines in palm oil mills. The current practice is to dump this waste in open land or landfill sites, which leads to environmental problems. The characterization of such waste to identify its suitability as a cement replacement materials, can ultimately lead to lower carbon footprint concrete. This paper presents the results of a study on the physical properties (particle size, specific surface, specific gravity, loss of ignition, morphology), chemical composition, organic carbon, thermal stability and mineralogical composition of palm oil clinker powder (POCP). The characterization was carried out using particle size analyzer, scanning electron microcopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), field emission scanning electron microcopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (FESEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques.

Title:
Workability and strength behaviour of concrete with cold-bonded fly ash aggregate
Abstract:
This paper discusses the development of empirical models for workability and compressive strength of cold-bonded fly ash aggregate concrete in terms of mixture proportioning variables such as cement content, water content and volume fraction of cold-bonded aggregate through statistically designed experiments based on Response Surface Methodology. Factor level of cement is taken from 250 to 450 kg/m3 to introduce weak as well as strong matrix phase in the concrete. Apart from water content, workability of concrete is highly influenced by main and interaction effect of volume fraction of cold-bonded aggregate in the composition. Response surface indicate that increase in cement content causes to change the predominant failure mode from mortar failure to aggregate fracture and concrete strength decreases with increase in volume fraction of aggregate at higher cement contents. The models developed have been found useful in arriving typical relationship to establish a mixture proportioning methodology for cold-bonded fly ash aggregate concrete.",['coal fly ash']

Title:
Corrosion protection performance of microsilica added concretes in NaCl and seawater environments
Abstract:
In a hardened concrete structure, diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide, aggressive ions and moisture from the concrete/environment to the concrete/rebar interfaces takes place through the pores. This results in the failure of the passivation provided by the alkalinity of the cement to the rebars. Microsilica is a mineral that improves the corrosion protection and strength of concrete by reducing the permeability of the concrete and forming more calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) which provides strength and durability to concrete. In order to study the corrosion protection behavior of microsilica in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and sulfate resistant cement (SRC), carbon steel reinforced concrete specimens of above cements containing 10% each of densified (DMS) and undensified (UDMS) microsilica were exposed to 5% NaCl solution and seawater. Corrosion of rebars was monitored using open circuit potential (OCP) measurements. Diffusion of ions into the concrete was studied by salt ingress, salt fog and rapid chloride permeability tests. It has been noted that densified microsilica provides better corrosion protection to the rebars than the undensified one. In addition to this its protective effect with SRC is much more than with OPC. An attempt has been made to explain the mechanism of corrosion protection behavior of microsilica added concrete immersed in seawater and NaCl solution.",['microsilica']

Title:
High-alumina cement production from FeNi-ERF slag, limestone and diasporic bauxite
Abstract:
In this paper the utilization of ferronickel electroreduction furnace (FeNi-ERF) slag for the production of high-alumina cement (HAC) is investigated through laboratory and pilot-scale tests. The process followed consisted of smelting reduction of slag mixtures with low-grade diasporic bauxite and limestone. In the laboratory-scale trials the main process parameters were defined, concerning raw material proportions, kinetics of the reductions and cooling rate of the product. The presence of a carbon-containing iron bath enhances FeOx reduction from the slag. Products from laboratory tests developed satisfactory compressive strengths relative to those of commercial HAC. According to the results of the laboratory tests, pilot-scale heat treatments were carried out in a 5-t electric arc furnace (EAF) and about 4 t of final mixture were produced.",['FeNi-ERF slag']

Contribution of acrylic fibre addition and ground granulated blast furnace slag on the properties of lightweight concrete
Abstract:
AbstractThe experimental investigation concerning the mechanical performance, drying shrinkage and residual strength upon heat exposure of acrylic fibre reinforced lightweight oil palm shell concrete (OPSC) containing ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is reported. The addition of 0.1% acrylic fibres in OPSC containing 20% GGBS was found to be the most effective in enhancing the tensile strength. The addition of acrylic fibres in OPSC was also found to reduce the 60-day drying shrinkage strains by up to 10% and improve the relative residual strength by up to 23%. Generally, the OPSC containing 20% GGBS had superior performance among the investigated hardened OPSC properties, except for the residual strength upon heat exposure, in which mixes with 70% GGBS achieved lower strength loss.",['blast furnace slag']

Diffusion of chloride ions in limestone filler blended cement pastes and mortars
Abstract:
The diffusion of chloride ions in neat cement pastes and mortars made with and without a limestone filler was investigated. In order to study the effect of the limestone filler, all mixtures were prepared at a fixed ratio (0,55). Test results indicate that the addition of a limestone filler reduces the diffusion coefficient of chloride ions. This reduction is attributed to the effect of the limestone filler particles on the tortuosity of the system. Results also indicate that the presence of interfaces has only a limited effect on the diffusion coefficient of chloride ions.",['limestone']

Title:
Investigation of the chemical, strength, adhesion and morphological properties of fly ash based geopolymer-modified bitumen
Abstract:
The current study seeks to investigate the chemical, strength, adhesion and morphological properties of fly-ash based geopolymer-modified bitumen (GMB). The geopolymer was prepared by mixing class F fly ash with alkaline solution (sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide), and was then mixed with an 80/100 penetration grade bitumen at different concentrations of 3, 5, 7 and 9% (by weight of bitumen) to produce the GMB. The chemical and strength properties of the binders were determined using the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Impact tests, respectively. The Surface Free Energy (SFE) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tests were conducted to establish the adhesion and morphology of the binders. The modification of base bitumen with geopolymer resulting the improvement in structural chain mobility properties and improved storage stability compared to those of the control sample. The result of FTIR analysis showed that the incorporation of geopolymer into base bitumen did not cause any change in the functional groups, where the peaks of aromatic C C stretching is at around 1600cm-1 (stretch), 1475cm-1 (stretch) and 900-600cm-1 (out-of-plane bend). The peak at around 1390cm-1 clearly shows the stretch of the C-N amine group. The result of SFE test shows that GMB has better resistance to moisture damage. Finally, the AFM analysis revealed morphological changes in all GMB samples. In general, the addition of 5% geopolymer can be considered as is the optimum concentration for bitumen modification.",['Class F fly ash']

Durability properties of high volume fly ash self compacting concretes
Abstract:
This paper presents an experimental study on the durability properties of self compacting concretes (SCCs) with high volume replacements of fly ash. Eight fly ash self compacting concretes of various strength grades were designed at desired fly ash percentages of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 85%, in comparison with five different mixtures of normal vibrated concretes (NCs) at equivalent strength grades. The durability properties were studied through the measurement of permeable voids, water absorption, acid attack and chloride permeation. The results indicated that the SCCs showed higher permeable voids and water absorption than the vibrated normal concretes of the same strength grades. However, in acid attack and chloride diffusion studies the high volume fly ash SCCs had significantly lower weight losses and chloride ion diffusion.",['coal fly ash']

Title:
Statistical models for the development of optimized furnace slag lightweight aggregate self-consolidating concrete
Abstract:
AbstractThis investigation aims to develop robust lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC) mixtures with furnace slag (FS) aggregates. A factorial design was carried out to mathematically model the influence of three key mix design parameters on fresh and hardened properties of furnace slag LWSCC (FS-LWSCC) mixtures. The parameters were water to binder ratio (w/b), high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA) content and total binder content. The responses of the derived statistical models were slump flow, V-funnel flow time, J-ring flow diameter/height difference, L-box ratio, filling capacity, sieve segregation, unit weight and compressive strength. Twenty mixes were prepared to derive the statistical models, and ten mixes were used to verify the accuracy of the developed models. The models were valid for mixes made with 0.30â0.40 w/b, HRWRA of 0.3â1.2% (by total binder content), and 410 to 550kg/m3 of total binder content. The influences of w/b, HRWRA% and total binder content were characterized and analyzed using regression technique to identify the primary factors and their interactions on the measured properties. Utilizing the developed models, three optimum FS-LWSCC mixtures with high statistical desirability were formulated and tested. It was possible to produce robust FS-LWSCCs that satisfy European EFNARC criteria.",['blast furnace slag']

Title:
Study on the development of inorganic polymers from red mud and slag system: Application in mortar and lightweight materials
Abstract:
The conversion of red mud into valuable products remains an important issue to be addressed. Inorganic polymers from red mud and slag system were investigated. Slag was substituted at 25, 50 and 75% by red mud in the system. Sodium silicate solutions of modulus ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 were used and the samples were cured at 25, 40 and 60 degC. Slag was amorphous phase while red mud contained some crystalline phases, mainly hematite, crancrinite and katoite. A better reactivity, faster setting and lower shrinkage were obtained for higher contents of slag, with a modulus of sodium silicate solution of 2.0. The composition made of 50% red mud and 50% slag achieved a 7 days compressive strength of 54 MPa at 25 degC. The use of standard sand and hydrogen peroxide allowed the formation of mortar and lightweight materials with reduced mechanical properties, but still of interest to address both issues of sustainable use of resources and CO2 reduction in construction.","['blast furnace slag', 'red mud']"

Title:
Abrasion resistance of alkali-activated slag concrete designed by Taguchi method
Abstract:
a b s t r a c t In this study, abrasion resistance of Alkali-Activated Slag (AAS) concrete was investigated according to ASTM C1138. Four affecting factors including curing temperature, alkaline solution to slag weight ratio, concentration of sodium hydroxide solution and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio were considered to achieve the maximum compressive strength and abrasion resistance of AAS concrete using the Taguchi design of experiment method. Based on the results, the mixture with alkaline solution to slag weight ratio of 0.45, sodium hydroxide concentration of 6 M and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio of 3, that had been cured at 95 C, and the mixture with alkaline solution to slag weight ratio of 0.4, sodium hydroxide concentration of 6 M and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio of 3, that had been cured at 25 C, were obtained as the optimal mixtures for maximum compressive strength and abrasion resistance, respectively. The results also showed that abrasion resistance of AAS concrete was significantly increased by improving the quality of surface and changing the curing regime. Water curing as an appropriate method improved the surface conditions and considerably increased the abrasion  resistance of AAS concrete too. In addition, the results showed that the CO2 footprint of AAS concrete was approximately 51% less than that of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete and therefore the eco-mechanical  performance of AAS concrete was superior.

Title:
Experimental study on the mechanical and thermal properties of basalt fiber and nanoclay reinforced polymer concrete
Abstract:
This paper describes the investigation of the synthesis and improvement of the mechanical properties of quaternary epoxy-based polymer concrete (PC) using basalt fiber and clay nanoparticles. First, the effect of chopped basalt fiber on the compressive, flexural, splitting tensile and impact strengths as well as the effect of different temperatures (up to 250 degC) on the strength of fiber reinforced PC were investigated experimentally. Basalt fiber improved the mechanical properties and increased the thermal stability of PC. In the next step, the effect of nanoclay particles on the mechanical properties and the effect of high temperatures (up to 250 degC) on the strength of basalt fiber-reinforced PC (BFRPC) were analyzed experimentally. Nanoparticles increase the compressive, flexural and impact strength as well as the thermal stability but decrease the tensile strength of the PC. SEM analysis was performed to study the fracture surface and morphology of various concrete specimens. The resulting polymer nanocomposite will be used as a lightweight polymer concrete with high mechanical strength and thermal stability.",['basalt fiber']

Behavior of high strength fly ash concrete columns under fire conditions
Abstract:
Fly ash concrete is finding increasing applications in construction; however there is lack of data on fire performance of fly ash concrete structural members. This paper presents results from fire resistance tests on fly ash concrete columns. Data generated from tests on high strength fly ash concrete columns is compared with those of conventional high strength concrete (HSC) columns. The effect of concrete type, fire exposure scenario, fly ash, and fibers in concrete mix on fire performance of fly ash concrete columns is discussed. Results from fire resistance tests show that fly ash concrete columns exhibit almost similar fire resistance to that of conventional HSC columns. Further, the addition of polypropylene fibers mitigates fire induced spalling in high strength fly ash concrete columns.",['coal fly ash']

Title:
Enhancing the thermal performance of Class F fly ash-based geopolymer by sodalite
Abstract:
Increased awareness and demand for fire safety of buildings are promoting research on fire-resistant materials, especially inorganic-based materials. One recent focus is geopolymers thanks to their high corrosion (acidic attack) and high-temperature resistance [1-3], in addition to their considerably eco-friendly characteristics. Geopolymers are formed by alkaline activation of aluminosilicate sources such as fly ash [4-5]. The lower water demand of fly ash-based geopolymers benefits in minimizing the damage caused by water evaporation during high-temperature exposure. Furthermore, compared to metakaolin-based geopolymers continuous sintering of fly ash particles triggered particle binding and strength increase with temperature increase. The aluminosilicate gel contributes essentially towards the high-temperature performance. However, geopolymers also release the physically and chemically bound water at elevated temperatures, which can destabilize the material structure and cause the thermal shrinkage and crack formation. Besides, the vapor pressure produced by both the physically and chemically absorbed water within the matrix will attempt to escape at elevated temperature. Thus, the level of thermally-induced damage is highly dependent on the pore structure of the material. Moreover, the research conducted by Ozawa and Shaikh showed that pure fly ash-based geopolymer did not exhibit the abrupt decrease in vapour pressure reported in cement-based and fly ash/slag-based materials, resulting in spalling and cracks, which may also demonstrate the advantageous utilization of fly ash in synthesis of geopolymer. Taking into account the enormous influence of the microstructure on geopolymer thermal degradation, the research focusing on the improvement of the matrix in order to address these issues is of great significance.",['Class F fly ash']

Title:
Study on solids-to-liquid and alkaline activator ratios on kaolin-based geopolymers
Abstract:
Kaolin and alkali activator were mixed with the solids-to-liquid ratios in range of 0.60-1.20 (Al2O3/Na2O molar ratio of 0.63-1.27). Sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide ranged between 0.16 and 0.36 (SiO2/Na2O molar ratio of 3.19-3.67) were mixed together to prepare alkali activator. The results concluded that compressive strength was affected by both S/L and Na2SiO3/NaOH ratios and strength increased with ageing day. Both these ratio also influenced the workability of the mixes. Besides, the kaolin geopolymers showed good volume stability in water. Compressive strength was highest at S/L and Na2SiO3/NaOH ratios of 1.00 and 0.32, respectively. In term of molar ratios, optimum was achieved at Al2O3/Na2O of 1.09 and SiO2/Na2O molar ratios of 3.58. Microstructures showed that kaolin particles were slightly activated with large part of unreacted raw materials remained in the system. Geopolymer sample reduced in peak intensities over time as presented by XRD analysis and the presence of crystalline peaks in the kaolin geopolymers was Zeolite X. FTIR analysis showed the presence of geopolymer bonding increased over age. In overall, kaolin geopolymers does not undergo complete geopolymerization and showed slow strength development. Vast research works have to be carried out to further improve the properties of kaolin geopolymers.",['kaolin']

Title:
Recycling of raw rice husk to manufacture magnesium oxysulfate cement based lightweight building materials
Abstract:
To reduce environmental pollution induced by the production of Portland cement-based building materials and eliminate the release of solid wastes from agriculture industry, this paper presents a newly-developed lightweight building material based on incorporating raw rice husk and foam bubbles in magnesium oxysulfate cement paste. Mechanical strength, bulk density, thermal conductivity and drying shrinkage of this material were carried out and phase composition, air bubble distribution and microstructure were studied on typical samples by using XRD (X-ray diffraction), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), OM (opto-digitial microscope) and SEM (scanning electron microscope) facilities. The results show that raw rice husk or/and foam bubble decrease compressive strength, thermal conductivity and bulk density. Compressive strength of this composite material at 28 days decreases from 70.4 MPa to 1.1 MPa when the bulk density ranges from 1722 kg/m3 to 450 kg/m3, being superior to traditional lightweight aggregate concretes. Drying shrinkage decreases with the incorporation of foam bubble and increases with the addition of raw rice husk. When the addition of raw rice husk is kept the same, there is an optimal dosage of foam bubble to obtain the lowest drying shrinkage. An excellent interfacial zone forms between raw rice husk and MOS cement paste due to numerous neat conical protrusions on the surface of rice husk particle. Therefore, this raw rice husk incorporated lightweight material has a great potential for applications to inner partition walls and thermal insulating components in buildings.",['raw rice husk']

Title:
Evaluation of tire rubber surface pre-treatment and silica fume on physical-mechanical behavior and microstructural properties of concrete
Abstract:
The increasing accumulation of tire waste has become a social environmental and public health problem because rubber degradation is extremely difficult to achieve and time consuming. The incorporation of rubber waste in concrete has become a recourse to assist in the disposal of this solid waste. This investigation evaluated the influence of a chemical pretreatment with sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) on the physical, mechanical, microstructural properties of concretes with two rubber residue contents (15% and 30%) as a natural fine aggregate replacement, and the addition of silica fume (7.5% and 15%) to replace Portland cement. X-ray microtomography and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the influence of treatment rubber and silica fume in the microstructure of concretes. The use of rubber in the cement matrix, regardless of the treatment (or lack thereof), decreases the concrete density (lower 10.5%) and compressive strength at 28d (54%), besides the increase the porosity (18%) than reference concretes. The rubber pre-treatment did not significantly influence the concrete behavior. In contrast, the use of silica fume showed significant compressive strength gains, up to 80% for concretes with 30% of rubber replacement at 28 days. These gains were confirmed by the microstructural analysis and the densification of the interfacial transition zone.","['rubber waste', 'silica fume']"

Accelerated carbonation of biochar reinforced cement-fly ash composites: Enhancing and sequestering CO2 in building materials
Abstract:
Biochar produced from the pyrolysis of corn stover biomass was added as a filler material in the cement-fly ash blocks as 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% of total weight. The resultant blocks were subjected to two hours mineral carbonation at (3day) after demoulding to enhance the CO2 uptake and sequester carbon in the blocks. Along with that, 28days compressive strength of un-carbonated blocks was determined to gauge the effect of biochar as the filler material on the strength of the specimens. Results showed that there was an enhanced CO2 uptake on 3days compressive strength and biochar dosage was optimised at 4% and 6% depending on the chosen mix. The 28days compressive strength of un-carbonated blocks showed that there was an increase in the strength as biochar addition increased to a certain extent, however, thereafter it decreased with the further addition of biochar.","['biochar', 'coal fly ash']"

Title:
The effect of waste rubber particles and silica fume on the mechanical properties of Roller Compacted Concrete Pavement
Abstract:
The current investigation discusses the potential use of recycled tire rubbers in roller compacted concrete pavement with the purpose of both improving its performance and reducing its environmental impacts. The main focus was on the basic properties of the roller compacted concrete, including the unit weight, the compressive strength, the flexural strength, and the water absorption of samples; thus, the particles of used tires were utilized as a replacement for the sand aggregate by 0, 5%, 10% ... and 35%. Also, the silica fume additive was used as a replacement for the cement material in eight mixes. The main point is that fresh specimens were compacted by a hammer, not a vibrator, in order to reach a homogeneous concrete. The results of the study showed an increase in the compressive strength of 28 days for different rubber contents 5% and 10%, without silica fume, and 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, with silica fume; however, the compressive strength was reduced for the other samples in comparison with the control specimen. Correspondingly, there was an increase in the flexural strength of 28 days for samples containing of 5% crumb rubber, with and without silica fume, although the flexural strength decreased for the other mixtures. Furthermore, the findings of the present investigation showed that the replacement of the sand by the used tire particles reduces water absorption, and this decrease was more obvious for samples with silica fume. In the final analysis, a regression model was defined to find a relationship between compressive and flexural strengths.","['silica fume', 'waste rubber particles']"

In this study, silica fume was used as a part of cementitious materials to improve the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC), which were made with fine and coarse recycled aggregates. Three series of mixtures were made in the laboratory. In the first and second series, coarse recycled aggregates with replacement of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% were used with and without silica fume. In the third series, 25% of fine recycled aggregates were replaced with fine natural aggregates. Slump flow and J-ring tests were considered for fresh state of SCC. The compressive strength, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity, electrical resistivity, and chloride ion penetration tests were performed for hardened concrete. The use of silica fume improved the properties of fresh SCC. The results showed that silica fume can reduce water absorption and porosity. The silica fume showed that can resulted in a significant increase in electrical resistivity. On the other h, the replacement of 25% of recycled aggregates did not have a significant effect on electrical resistivity, the electrical resistivity decreased by increasing the amount of replacement. Silica fume was very effective in controlling chloride ion penetration and reducing total charge passed. Silica fume also controlled the temperature of the solutions used during the test which indicates the control of the movement of ions in the penetration into concrete.","['silica fume', 'fine recycled concrete aggregate', 'coarse recycled concrete aggregate']"

Title:
Evaluation of the sulfate resistance of concrete containing palm oil fuel ash
Abstract:
The effects of using palm oil fuel ash (POFA) as a new pozzolanic material on sulfate resistance in terms of expansion and loss in compressive strength of concretes exposed to 5% MgSO4 solution for up to 24 months were evaluated. POFA was processed to obtain different sized particles: small and medium sizes (SP and MP) were produced by grinding, and the large size (LP) used unground POFA. Portland cement type I was replaced by SP, MP, and LP at a level of 10-40% by weight of binder. Results showed that unground POFA (LP) is not suitable for use as a cement replacement in concrete because it produces low compressive strength and can not improve the sulfate resistance of concrete. Increasing proportions of ground POFA (MP and SP), caused a decrease in the expansion of concrete bars and an increase in the loss in compressive strength. However, the expansion and loss in compressive strength were reduced when the POFA fineness was increased. The results suggested that ground POFA (MP and SP) could be used as a pozzolanic material and could also improve the sulfate resistance of concrete.",['palm oil fuel ash']

Title:
The effect of using natural zeolite on the properties and hydration characteristics of blended cements
Abstract:
In this study, various properties and the hydration mechanisms of cements containing natural zeolite were investigated. In the first stage a complete physical, chemical, mineralogical, molecular characterization of the zeolite and cement was performed. In the second stage, the mechanical and physical properties of blended cements, incorporating 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% zeolite by weight were determined. Finally, the hydration rate and products of cement pastes were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 28days. As it is concluded, the examined zeolite consists mainly of cliniptilolite, which reacts with the Ca(OH)2 generated during the hydration of Portland cement to form cement-like hydrated products. Finally, the addition of zeolite has affected the physical and mechanical properties of the blended cements depending on the amount of zeolite.",['zeolite']

Title:
Evaluation of blends of high and low calcium fly ashes for use as supplementary cementing materials
Abstract:
The present paper outlines the results of a research attempt aimed at developing and evaluating the performance of ternary blended cements, incorporating mixtures of two different types of fly ash (of high and low calcium content). The main target of this study was to investigate whether and by what means, the introduction of a certain type of fly ash into a fly ashâcement (FC) matrix containing a different type of ash, can improve the performance of the initial binary system. For achieving this, new pozzolans were prepared by mixing, in selected proportions, a high lime fly ash with an ash of lower calcium content. The efficiency of the new materials was examined in terms of active silica content, pozzolanic activity potential, strength development, k-values and progress of the pozzolanic action by means of fixed lime capabilities. The results obtained demonstrated that the mixtures containing equal amounts of each fly ash were the most effective for moderate cement substitution, whilst for higher replacements the intermixture possessing the highest active silica content shows supremacy at almost all hydration ages. The superior performance of the ternary fly ash blends was mainly attributed to synergistic effects detected for all the ashes utilized. These were quantified in each case and almost linear correlations were obtained with the k-values of the most efficient ternary mixes.","['Class C fly ash', 'Class F fly ash']"

Title:
Nanoindentation study of calcium silicate hydrates in concrete produced with effective microorganisms-based bioplasticizer
Abstract:
The mechanical properties of concrete produced with effective microorganisms (EM)-based bioplasticizer are investigated by means of statistical nanoindentation, and compared to the nanomechanical properties of concrete produced with ordinary superplasticizer (SP). The resort to nanoindentation enables to survey the elasticity, hardness and long-term logarithmic relaxation behavior of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) after few minutes only. For each material, a cluster analysis of the experimental results yields groupings of indents likely performed on C-S-H with distinct packing densities. It is found that the addition of EM-based bioplasticizer improves the strength of C-S-H by enhancing the cohesion and friction of solid nanograins, and decreases the absolute rate of long-term relaxation. The statistical analysis of indentation results also suggests that EM-based bioplasticizer inhibits the precipitation of C-S-H of higher density. The findings of this work corroborate the results of a previous study which attributed an increase of homogeneity and a refinement of the crystalline structure of silicate phases to the effect of a biomodifier similar to EM-based bioplasticizer. The improvement of strength properties of C-S-H is also shown to coincide with a gain of compressive strength measured at the macroscale of EM-based concrete.",['microorganisms-based bioplasticizer']

Title:
The effect of natural zeolites on the early hydration of Portland cement
Abstract:
In this work, the effect of zeolite, coming from Pentalofos area, Thrace, Greece, on the hydration of cement is examined. The experimental part comprises three stages: In the first stage a complete mineralogical characterization of the zeolite was performed. In addition, the pozzolanic reactivity of the zeolite was evaluated on the basis of Chapelle test. In the second stage, pastes of Portland cement, incorporating 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% per weight of fine zeolite were prepared. The pastes were water-cured at 20 degC, for 1, 2, 7 and 28 days. Finally, the hydration rate and products were studied by means of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in combination with thermoanalytical methods (TG/DTG and differential thermal analysis). As it is concluded, the examined zeolite consists mainly of ""heulandite type II"" and shows a good pozzolanic reactivity (0.555 g of Ca(OH)2 per gram of zeolite, according to the Chapelle test). The incorporation of zeolite in cement contributes to the consumption of Ca(OH)2 formed during the cement hydration and the formation of cement-like hydrated products.",['zeolite']

Title:
Improvement in corrosion resistance of recycled aggregate concrete by nano silica suspension modification on recycled aggregates
Abstract:
This work modified recycled aggregates (RAs) by soaking them in a nano-silica (NS) suspension and evaluated the modification effects on recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Firstly, different soaking times were studied based on the surface microhardness and the penetration depth of NS particles in the RA. Secondly, mechanical properties (e.g., compressive strength and microhardness of interfacial transition zones) and durability properties (e.g., steel corrosion and corrosion-induced cracking) were tested. The 1-h soaking modification was selected as the optimal soaking time. The nano-modification improved the protection of steel and the resistance to corrosion-induced cracking, which was believed to be related to the improvement of the ITZ properties according to the microhardness test results.",['recycled aggregate']

Efficient reuse of the recycled construction waste cementitious materials
Abstract:
This paper addresses the efficiently reuse of the recycled construction waste cementitious materials (RCWCM). The RCWCM is firstly collected, and then subjected to crushing, grinding and thermal treatments, respectively. After that, the obtained powder material is named dehydrated cement paste (DCP) in this study. Due to the fact that the DCP has relatively high pH value and high activity, two specific attempts are tried to efficiently reuse the obtained DCP. The results show that it is possible to produce a prefabricated building material with an industry by-product (fly ash) and a recycled waste material (DCP). The compressive strength of the produced prefabricated building material can be higher than 60MPa. Additionally, after being further dispersed, the DCP could be utilized as a high performance cement additive, which can significantly promote the hydration and microstructure development of cement.",['construction waste']

Title:
Ecological carbonated steel slag pervious concrete prepared as a key material of sponge city
Abstract:
A pervious concrete with carbonated ground steel slag powder as binder and crushed steel slag as aggregate was prepared, which provided the key material for construction of sponge city and explored a new approach to massively utilize steel slag. This paper presented series of experimental studies on the properties of steel slag carbonized consolidation matrix and carbonated steel slag pervious concrete. Results indicated that the phosphogypsum promoted the carbonization ratio of steel slag. When the content of phosphogypsum was 2.5%, strength and carbonization ratio of carbonated steel slag from pressing formation reached 82.6MPa and 52.1% respectively. The main product of the carbonated steel slag was calcite and C-S-H. The strength and porosity of carbonated steel slag pervious concrete reached 9.4MPa and higher than 20% respectively. And it also had a good plantability when it is used in sponge city construction. Compared with ordinary pervious concrete, carbonated steel slag pervious concrete saved 75.8% cost of materials, was 100% made of solid waste and absorbed around 100kg/m3 of CO2, which turns out to be a green and high-efficiency approach to utilize the solid waste steel slag, saving the natural resource and reducing the carbon footprint of the construction of sponge city.","['steel slag', 'steel slag']"

Title:
Use of pretreatment to prevent expansion and foaming in high-performance MSWI bottom ash alkali-activated mortars
Abstract:
This study has investigated the impact of foaming and expansion of municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash (BA) during alkali reaction. Furthermore, the activity enhancement of the BA has been investigated. Based on the microanalytic appearance and compressive strength of the samples, the results show that the reaction between the metallic aluminium in the BA and alkali in the activator, which produced large quantities of hydrogen, is the primary cause for both foaming and expansion. The residual organic matter and unburnt substances in the BA are the main factors that affect the activity. However, the alkali defoaming and calcination-melting pretreatments completely prevented the expansion and calcining further improved the BA activity. The alkali activated materials prepared with the BA calcined at 700degC, granulated blast furnace slag, and slaked lime followed by alkali defoaming pretreatment produced the best mechanical properties.","['MSWI bottom ash', 'blast furnace slag']"

Title:
Recycling of crushed stone powder as a partial replacement for silica powder in extruded cement panels
Abstract:
The continuously increasing amount of crushed stone powder normally coming from the production of crushed aggregates or sawing stone has led to an increase in the waste disposal costs or instances of improper disposal. In this study, the effective methodology to increase the utilization of crushed stone powder was studied by considering CaO/SiO2 mole ratio in mix design. The hydrothermal reaction to synthesis tobermorite related to strength development was also considered to improve rigidity in hardened cement. The results showed the optimized C/S mole ratio is 0.87 and a valid method for curing conditions relating to hardened cement was desired to be acquired by 2h of pre-curing, 4h of atmosphere steam curing (65degC) and 4h of autoclave curing (180degC, 10atm). The extruded panels satisfied all performance requirements relating to fire resistance as well as sound insulation and can have a possible application to building materials.

Title:
Pore structure and surface area of hardened cement pastes containing silica fume
Abstract:
Specific surface areas and pore structure studies were carried out on the hardened cement pastes containing various amounts of silica fume after being hydrated for different ages. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined for all pastes at the boiling point of nitrogen, from low pressures to the saturation pressure. The effect of content of silica fume on the properties of the silica fume-Portland cement pastes was discussed. The specific surface areas as well as the total pore volume were found to decrease with increasing amount of silica fume as hydration proceeded. The variations of the nitrogen surface area, the total pore volume and the mean hydraulic radius of the total pore system accessible to nitrogen molecules are discussed and the results are related as much as possible to the formed hydrates.",['silica fume']

Title:
Calcined clay limestone cements (LC3)
Abstract:
The use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to replace part of the clinker in cement is the most successful strategy to reduce CO2 emissions in the global cement industry. However, limited supplies of conventional SCMs make it difficult to take this strategy further unless new types of SCMs become available. The only type of material available in the quantities needed to meet demand is clay containing kaolinite, which can be calcined to produce an effective SCM. Such clays are widely available in countries where most growth in demand for cement is forecast.","['calcined clay', 'limestone']"

Title:
Evaluation of Industrial by-products as pozzolans: A road map for use in concrete production
Abstract:
According to the Resource Efficiency Roadmap, the building sector is one of the key sectors addressing the challenges of energy, climate change and resource efficiency. The presence of legally binding guidelines in EU legislation regarding waste has already contributed significantly to waste management practices and innovations in the field of recycling; it has also limited the landfilling process and created incentives to change consumer habits. Thus, it is important to focus on the efficient use of resources by replacing commercially-available products with industrial by-products or waste materials. The concrete industry is the largest in the building sector, so the focus of reaching the targets mentioned above is in the daily scope for engineers and researchers. Reducing the costly and environmentally aggressive Portland cement and increasing concrete durability are the targets that act as guidelines for concrete development. Both issues have proven to be partially solved by incorporating supplementary cementitious materials, also known as pozzolans, in concrete composition. Following the American standard ASTM C125, the pozzolans contain siliceous and aluminous materials, which possess little or no cementitious value but will, in finely divided forms in the presence of moisture, react chemically with calcium hydroxide at ordinary temperatures to form compounds possessing cementitious properties. Pozzolans are usually introduced in the composition of concrete to reduce the amount of cement needed and improve its durability. Pozzolans reduce absorption, permeability and ion diffusivity by reducing the porosity of the binder due to the formation of a calcium silicate hydrate gel from the pozzolan and excess Ca(OH)2 coming from the Portland cement. The amount of pozzolans introduced varies, from 5 to 40 wt.% of the cement. The typical natural pozzolans are metakaolin , pumice and natural zeolites , while the most popular commercial material used as a pozzolan in the concrete industry is silica fume and fly ash [,]. Different waste-origin pozzolans are being intensively researched as alternatives to existing ones, and the most promising are calcined clay and glass waste, different types of ashes including coal bottom ash, which could reduce the total cement content by 20 wt.%, retaining the given strength class and also reducing concrete cost by 9%. The major concern regarding the use of waste glass as supplementary cementitious materials are alkali content. It is concluded that alkali content within glasses should be limited to a maximum of 4%. This is why in this research two types of glasses were evaluated regarding to its alkali content - low alkali glass (<4%) and high alkali content glass (>4%).","['calcined clay', 'glass waste', 'coal bottom ash']"

Title:
Influence of seawater and blast furnace cement employment on recycled aggregate concretesâ properties
Abstract:
AbstractRecycled aggregates of mixed composition (MRA) may exhibit great variability in their properties, which in turn reduces their applicability. This study intends to extend the use of MRA in a broadened scope of applications by producing recycled aggregate concretes (RAC), which were mixed using two different types of cement, ordinary Portland cement and cement incorporating blast-furnace slag, and two types of water, fresh and seawater. The testing programme included analyses of the properties of concrete in its fresh (setting time and plastic shrinkage) and hardened state (physical, mechanical and drying shrinkage). The results showed that all of the physical and several of the mechanical properties as well as drying shrinkage were negatively influenced by the use of MRA. In contrast, however, the plastic shrinkage and flexural strength were improved. The use of seawater improved the mechanical properties, reduced setting time and increased drying shrinkage, however, it was found that the cement type was more influential on most of the properties. The use of seawater and cement with blast-furnace slag improved the performances of the RAC.","['blast furnace slag', 'recycled aggregate']"

Title:
Recycling steel-manufacturing slag and harbor sediment into construction materials
Abstract:
Mixtures consisting of harbor sediment and slag waste from steel industry containing toxic components are fired to produce non-hazardous construction materials. The fired pellets become lighter as firing temperature increases. At a sintering temperature of <=1050 degC, the fired pellets are in a form of brick-like product, while at 1100 degC, they become lightweight aggregates. Calcium silicate, kyanite, and cristobalite are newly formed in the pellets after firing, demonstrating that calcium oxide acts as a flux component and chemically reacted with Si- and/or Al-containing components to promote sintering. Dioxin/furan content present in the pure slag is 0.003 ng I-TEQ g-1, for the fired pellet consisting of slag and sediment, the content appears to be destructed and diminishes to 0.0003 ng I-TEQ g-1 after 950 degC-firing; while it is 0.002 ng I-TEQ g-1 after firing at 1100 degC, suggesting that dioxins/furans in the 950 degC-fired pellets have a greater chance to escape to atmosphere due to a slower sintering reaction and/or that construction of dioxins/furans from molten chloride salts co-exists with their destruction. Multiple toxicity characteristic leaching procedure extracts Cu, Cr, Zn, Se, Cd, Pb, Ba, As, and Hg from all fired products at negligible levels.","['steel slag', 'harbor sediment']"

Title:
The influence of silica fume on the corrosion resistance of steel in high performance concrete exposed to simulated sea water
Abstract:
This investigation examined the influence of silica fume on the corrosion behaviour of steel in high performance concrete (HPC) by comparing the behaviour of HPC concretes with and without a 10% by mass of cement addition of silica fume. Reinforced concrete prisms (500 x 100 x 100 mm) with embedded corrosion probes were loaded in three-point bending to achieve a 0.3 mm crack and exposed to simulated sea water for up to four years. Corresponding prisms without induced cracks were also studied as controls. For the HPC with silica fume, pore size distribution measurements showed that after exposure to the simulated sea water, the hydration and pozzolanic reactions near the induced crack blocked almost all continuous pores in the 0.01 to 10 Î¼m range. This affected the type and distribution of corrosion products that formed by restricting the access of chlorides and oxygen to the surface of the steel. Thus, only magnetite (Fe3O4) formed and was confined the space provided by the induced crack, effectively plugging the crack. In HPC without silica fume, oxygenated corrosion products such as goethite (Î±-FeOOH) and akaganeite (Î²-FeOOH) formed in the induced crack region. The implications of these observations on the service life of high performance concrete structures are discussed.",['silica fume']

Greening effect in slag cement materials
Abstract:
This article presents the first spectroscopic data describing the processes responsible for the temporary blue-green coloration that forms during the hydration of various materials containing Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS) under anoxic conditions. UV-visible-near infrared Diffuse Reflectance (DR) spectra demonstrate a striking similarity of the coloring center forming during the curing of a broad range of GGBS-bearing materials (pure GGBS with different compositions, mix Portland cement/GGBS (30/70), concrete and mortar). All spectra are similar to those of polysulfide complexes contained in the interlayer spacing of a synthetic green-colored hydrated calcium aluminate phase (AFm). This ""greening effect"" demonstrates a progressive oxidation of sulfide-based compounds initially contained in these materials during curing of GGBS bearing materials.",['blast furnace slag']

Title:
Production of supplementary cementitious material as a sustainable management strategy for water treatment sludge waste
Abstract:
This paper investigates the application of Water Treatment Sludge (WTS), the main waste generated by water potabilization activities, for the development of a Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM). The waste has been processed by calcining at a temperature range of 600 degC-800 degC for one hour. Chemical, mineralogical, physical, and morphological characterization has been performed to identify the potential pozzolanic activity of the calcined WTS and validate the application as SCM. Compressive strength tests have been performed in cement mortars with 14%, 35%, and 50% replacement of Portland cement by WTS. The WTS is a non-hazardous and non-inert waste, composed of SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and contains essentially quartz and kaolinite. Results confirmed the transformation of kaolinite into reactive amorphous phase by calcining. WTS calcined at 600 degC shows great potential to the production of SCM, confirmed by the chemical and physical analysis and the evidence of pozzolanic activity. The mechanical properties of mortars produced with 14% and 35% WTS calcined at 600 degC suggests a promising application in the production of blended and pozzolanic Portland cement.",['water treatment sludge waste']

Title:
Comparison of alkaliâsilica reactions in alkali-activated slag and Portland cement mortars
Abstract:
Alkali-silica reactions (ASR) in alkali-activated slag (AAS) and Portland cement (PC) mortars were studied to compare their expansions and products. ASR expansions were measured following ASTM C1260 with modified curing and exposure conditions. Scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM/EDX) was used to characterize the ASR products in both types of mortar after 28 days of testing. The concentration of OH- in the extraction solution of all the mortars at different ages was determined by ex situ extraction method. The results showed that AAS mortars exhibited lower ASR expansion than the PC mortars when they were exposed to 1 N NaOH solution. The observation of ASR products in the AAS mortars under water and steam exposure conditions supported the presence of their minor ASR expansions, which were not observed in the corresponding PC mortars. SEM/EDX observation and analyses demonstrated obviously different morphologies of AAS mortars under different exposure conditions. The lower ASR expansion of mortars can be explained by their lower concentration of OH- in the extraction solution, which might reflect the relative alkalinity in their pore solution.",['blast furnace slag']

Title:
Mechanical Fracture Parameters of Cement Based Mortars with Waste Glass Powder
Abstract:
Glass is an amorphous solid substance with pozzolanic properties that can be used as a partial substitute for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in cement based composites. In the research conducted for this paper, the PC was partially replaced by fine-ground waste laboratory borosilicate glass (in mixtures where 5, 10, 15 and 20% by mass was substituted). Beam specimens with the dimensions 40 x 40 x 160 mm were prepared from each mixture. After demoulding, the specimens were kept under standard laboratory conditions. Basic tests were conducted at the age of 7, 28, 56, and 90 days: the compressive (f c) and flexural (f f) strengths were determined according to the CSN EN 1015-11 standard. Specimens were also subjected to fracture testing at the age of 28 days. The beam specimens with an initial central edge notch were tested in three-point bending. Load vs. displacement diagrams were recorded and modulus of elasticity (E), fracture toughness (K Ic e) and fracture energy (G F *) were determined. It was found, that strength increased with specimen age: at the age 28 days this increase was 12-33% in case of f c, and 6-15% as regards f f. The values obtained for almost all the parameters decreased with the increasing dosage of glass as a replacement for cement: compared to a reference composite this decrease was 22-40% in the case of f c, 24-28% for f f, 3-5% for E, 9-29% for K Ic e, and 30-50% for G F *; exceptions were recorded for glass replacement doses of 5 and 10%, where increases of 2-6% for f c and 8-10% for E were obtained.",['waste glass']

Title:
Potassium geopolymer foams made with silica fume pore forming agent for thermal insulation
Abstract:
Porous potassium based geopolymers with a mutli-scale porosity were synthesized. Silica fume is introduced as an additive to the geopolymer formulation. The free silicon contained inside this silica fume is oxidized in alkaline solution, releasing molecular hydrogen which generates the porosity. Previous work has shown how the porosity can be controlled with temperature, repeated temperature cycles and the mass introduced. Using this protocol, homogeneous foams were made and then studied with scanning electron microscopy. In particular the foam expansion has been followed with time in relation to the microstructure. The thermal conductivity values of the foams were evaluated using a fluxmeter method. The effective thermal conductivities are comprised between 0.12 and 0.35 W m-1 K-1 for apparent densities ranging from 0.40 to 0.85 g cm-3. The corresponding calculated pore volume fractions are in the range of 65-85%. The interest of this material is that it combines the advantages of low bulk density and insulating properties with the characteristics of a geopolymer skeleton. Literature reports a very good fire and acid/base resistance, a low cost of production and the possibility of recycling industrial waste in the form of silica fume.",['silica fume']

Macro/micro-pore structure characteristics and the chloride penetration of self-compacting concrete incorporating different types of filler and mineral admixture
Abstract:
The relationship between the internal pore structure features at different scales and the local micro-characteristics of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) to the non-steady state chloride migration coefficient (Dnssm) is investigated for one normal and three types of sustainable high performance self-compacting concrete mixes. The pore structure classification at different scales and the percolation degrees of the ITZ's pores were determined using both vacuum-saturated and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) techniques. Further, the local micro-permeation features of the ITZ, such as thickness, porosity and the chemistry of its hydration products is examined using the SEM coupled with the EDX analysis on polished, carbon-coated, flat specimens. Chloride movement was achieved using a modified rapid migration test.",['mineral']

Preparation of sulphoaluminate belite cement from fly ash
Abstract:
Sulphoaluminate belite cements containing the phases C2S, C4A3 S, C4AF, CS were synthesised from limestone, fly ash and gypsum at 1200 degC. The correspondence between the predicted phase composition and real phase composition were checked. The influence of quantities of different phases in the hydration behaviour and strength development were verified. Results show that an optimum proportion of phase quantities help in high strenght development in early age. These cements fulfill all the requirement of Portland cement and have very high early strength. Porosity measurements show that the total pore volume in early period is comparatively less than that of Ordinary Portland Cement. Thus these cements can be usable for special purposes.","['coal fly ash', 'limestone', 'gypsum']"

Title:
Effect of silica fume and fly ash on hydration and microstructure evolution of cement based composites at low waterâbinder ratios
Abstract:
The hydration process of ultra-high performance cementitious composite (UHPCC) is distinctly different from common concrete owing to its low water-binder ratio (w/b). The effects of silica fume and fly ash on the hydration process and microstructure were investigated via different characterization methods in this work. The results indicated that the hydration process could be accelerated at the beginning by addition of silica fume, and fly ash, on the other h, retarded hydration mainly in the dormant and acceleration periods. When they were incorporated together in cement, the result differed significantly from cement hydration at higher w/b (>0.35). As a result of Ca(OH)2 consumption by pozzolanic reaction, the porosity reduced (<4%) and the interface strengthened as the curing time increased. Nanoindentation results revealed that most hydration products of UHPCC were UHD C-S-H and unhydrated cement. The unhydrated cement particles were surrounded by UHD C-S-H, implying that the UHPCC had excellent mechanical performance and durability.","['silica fume', 'coal fly ash']"

Title:
Exploitation of poor Greek kaolins: strength development of metakaolin concrete and evaluation by means of k-value
Abstract:
In this paper, the effect of metakaolin on concrete properties is investigated. A poor Greek kaolin was thermally treated at defined conditions, and the produced metakaolin was superfine ground. In addition, a commercial metakaolin of high purity was used. Eight mixture proportions were used to produce high-performance concrete, where metakaolin replaced either cement or sand in percentages of 10% or 20% by weight of the control cement content. The strength development of metakaolin concrete was evaluated using the efficiency factor (k-value). The produced metakaolin as well as the commercial one imparts a similar behavior with respect to the concrete strength. Both metakaolins exhibit very high k-values (close to 3.0 at 28 days) and are characterised as highly reactive pozzolanic materials that can lead to concrete production with an excellent performance.",['metakaolin']

Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of using limestone powder and Shirasu natural pozzolan, as partial replacements for fine aggregate, on the mechanical properties and resistance of concrete to an aggressive solution containing 3% H2SO4 and 5% MgCl2. The data show that replacing 5% of the fine aggregate with limestone powder results in more severe deterioration of the concrete by the chemical solution. However, replacing 55% of the fine aggregate with Shirasu both increases compressive strength after a 28-day cure and improves chemical resistance of concrete. In addition, the deterioration mechanism of concrete immersed in the aggressive solution was examined in this study.","['limestone powder', 'natural pozzolan']"

Title:
Effect of new mixing method of glass powder as cement replacement on mechanical behavior of concrete
Abstract:
This study investigates the effects of using local wastes of Glass Powder (produced from crushing the glass waste) as replacement of cement in fresh and hardened concrete. Four percentages of Glass Powder (GP) were used: 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%. Two mixing methods were used in the study. First, the conventional mixing method, where the glass powder was added with the cement and aggregates. Second, the glass powder was dissolved in water before adding it to cement and aggregates. The slump increased as the glass powder replacement increased in the concrete due to the presence of more free water in the structure, which leaded to have lower density and higher water absorption. As a result, the compressive strength of conventional mixes method decreased as the glass powder increased at early age. Later, after 90 days, the highest compressive strength was obtained for the 20% GP. The new mixing method showed higher compressive strength than the conventional mixing method. Using 10% GP in the new mixing method gave a significant increase, around 130% of the compressive strength of the control mix. This increase can be related to the hydrolysis of the glass powder into free ions of SiO2, CaO and Na2O in the water which formed more CSH. The relative index proves the rise of the glass powder reactivity as the amount of glass powder increases.",['waste glass']

Title:
Synergistic utilization of red mud for flue-gas desulfurization and fly ash-based geopolymer preparation
Abstract:
As an industrial waste characterized by huge volume and high alkalinity, red mud has become a serious environmental problem. The reuse of red mud has been explored in previous studies, including as building materials and for soil and waste water treatment. In this study, an innovation was made for the reuse of red mud to create a synergistic effect. Red mud was first used in flue gas desulfurization (FGD), and then the desulfurized red mud was again reused to make a geopolymer material. By using one type of original red mud and three types of fly ash, this study revealed that with high alkalinity and desulfurization capacity, the red mud could serve as an excellent FGD sorbent. After FGD, the sodium sulfate in the desulfurized red mud acted as a chemical activator for geopolymer made with class C fly ash. A 25% increase in strength was observed between the geopolymers with the red mud after FGD and with the original one. There are no significant benefits of FGD on the class F fly ash-based geopolymers and further study is required.","['red mud', 'Class C fly ash']"

Title:
Stabilization of Recycled Demolition Aggregates by Geopolymers comprising Calcium Carbide Residue, Fly Ash and Slag precursors
Abstract:
Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) is the by-product of acetylene gas production. In this research, the alkali activation of Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) was studied as an economical and low-carbon precursor for development of geopolymer binder. Recycled Concrete aggregates (RCA) and Crushed Brick (CB) are the two major demolition material sources for the Construction and Demolition (C&D) industry. The cement stabilization of C&D materials has been evaluated in recent years, however due to the large carbon footprint associated with Portland cement, geopolymers which utilize the alkali activation of industrial waste by-products have garnered increasing interest from industry. Evaluation of the geopolymer stabilization of C&D materials with CCR precursor were also compared with traditional Fly Ash (FA) and Slag (S) precursors. In addition, the performance of CCR based geopolymers with supplementary FA and S precursors were also evaluated. The three precursors (CCR, FA, S) were combined with contents of up to 10% for the geopolymer stabilization of the C&D materials. A liquid alkaline activator comprising sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used for the alkali activation of the CCR based geopolymers. The strength and durability of the geopolymer stabilized C&D materials were evaluated to ascertain their application in pavement bases/subbases. The results of Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Resilient Modulus (MR) testing of these geopolymer stabilized CB and RCA aggregates indicate that different mixtures of CCR based geopolymers can be used to improve the strength properties of the C&D aggregates for pavement base/subbase applications. CCR + 5% S with the C&D materials resulted in the optimum combination for CCR based geopolymer stabilization of C&D aggregates.","['construction and demolition waste', 'calcium carbide residue', 'fly ash', 'blast furnace slag']"

Title:
Chemical interactions between siliceous aggregates and low-Ca alkali-activated cements
Abstract:
The chemical interactions between natural siliceous aggregates and a low-Ca alkali-activated cement (geopolymer) were studied. By leaching ideal aluminosilicate minerals such as kaolinite and albite in various alkaline solutions with or without soluble silicates, it was found that addition of 0.5M SiO2 to a highly alkaline activating solution ([OH-]0=5 to 10M) was responsible for the formation of an Al-enriched aluminosilicate surface through the initial non-stoichiometric and Si preferential dissolution of the parent aluminosilicates. This then facilitated soluble silicate deposition from the activating solutions onto the Al-rich surfaces, which resulted in the formation of a dense deposited aluminosilicate gel interfacial layer. This aluminosilicate interface formed during albite leaching ([OH-]0=5 to 10M and [SiO2]0=0.5M) was found to possess a similar Si/Al ratio to the real interface between a siliceous aggregate slice (basalt or siltstone) and a low-Ca fly ash/kaolinite geopolymer, activated with an activating solution of [OH-]0=10M and [SiO2]0=2.5M. Due to the similarities between the activating solutions used and the interfaces formed, it is postulated that a similar formation mechanism is shared between the deposited aluminosilicate interface formed from leaching and a 'real' geopolymer concrete synthesis. Without soluble silicate addition, or if a solution of low alkalinity ([OH-]0=0.6M and [SiO2]0=0 and 0.5M) was used, the Al-enriched reacting surface was not formed, and no deposited aluminosilicate interface was observed in these systems.","['kaolinite', 'albite', 'basalt', 'siltstone']"

Title:
Physical and mechanical properties of unheated and heated kaolin based-geopolymers with partial replacement of aluminium hydroxide
Abstract:
Amorphous aluminium hydroxide and aluminium oxy-hydroxide were used as replacements in the synthesis of kaolin based-geopolymers. Physical and mechanical properties of geopolymers cured at 60 degC and exposed at elevated temperatures (300-1200 degC) were investigated. It was found that when cured at 60 degC, specimens with replacements exhibited low compressive strength as compared to those without replacement. Conversely, when heated as from 1100 degC, both compressive strength and volume stability of specimens with replacement were improved. Thus, specimens without replacement were morphologically damaged at 1150 degC whereas those with 10% by mass of amorphous aluminium hydroxide or with 30% by mass of aluminium oxy-hydroxide showed good volume stability at 1150 and 1200 degC respectively. Additionally, geopolymers with 30% by mass of aluminium oxy-hydroxide that were heated at 1100 degC showed compressive strength of 29.1 MPa whereas those with 10% by mass of amorphous aluminium hydroxide gave 60.2 MPa at 1150 degC. This was attributed to the improvement of compactness of specimens along with the formation of stable crystalline phases. Yet, heating geopolymers at 1200 degC led to partial dissolution of nepheline and carnegieite which generates closed pores hence decrease of compressive strength. Partial replacement of amorphous aluminium hydroxide or aluminium oxy-hydroxide in the synthesis of kaolin-based geopolymers allows both improvement of compressive strength and thermal stability of heated kaolin-based geopolymers.","['aluminium hydroxide', 'kaolin']"

Abstract:
The particle size distributions of slag powder were investigated by Laser Scatter equipment. The influence of particle fractions of slag powder on the compressive strength of slag cement composed of 50% slag powder and 50% Portland cement was also studied by the method of grey correlation analysis. The results indicated that the volume fraction of particles 5-10Î¼m had a maximum positive effect on the mortar compressive strength of slag cement at 7d and the volume fraction of particles 10-20Î¼m had a maximum positive effect on the mortar compressive strength at 28d, whereas the volume fraction of particles larger than 20Î¼m had a negative effect on the mortar compressive strength at 7 and 28d.",['blast furnace slag']

Title:
Experimental characterization of binary and ternary blended-cement concretes containing ultrafine residual rice husk and sugar cane bagasse ashes
Abstract:
AbstractIn the present work an experimental program was carried out to investigate the influence of residual sugar cane bagasse and rice husk ashes (SCBA and RHA, respectively) in the properties of concretes. SCBA and RHA were produced using vibratory grinding in dry open circuit and conventional and high-performance concretes were produced with 0% and 20% of both ashes as cement replacement (by mass). Ternary mixtures containing cement, SCBA and RHA (0.6â0.2â0.2) were also produced in order to study the benefits of the simultaneous use of both ultrafine ashes on concrete properties. Experiments were performed to investigate the rheology (yield stress and plastic viscosity), compressive strength (at 7, 28, 90, and 180days), Youngâs modulus (at 28days) and rapid chloride-ion penetrability. The pore size distribution and adiabatic temperature rise of the reference and ternary mixtures were also evaluated. The joint influence of both ashes allowed reaching positive effects in rheology and kept constant or increased the compressive strength when compared to the reference mixtures. Moreover, the ternary concretes presented lower electric charges and the replacement of cement by 40% SCBA and RHA decreased significantly the maximum adiabatic temperature rise of conventional concrete.","['rice husk ash', 'sugar cane bagasse ash']"

Title:
The role of SiO2 nanoparticles and ground granulated blast furnace slag admixtures on physical, thermal and mechanical properties of self compacting concrete
Abstract:
In this work, strength assessments and percentage of water absorption of self compacting concrete containing ground granulated blast furnace slag and SiO2 nanoparticles as binder have been investigated. Portland cement was replaced by different amounts of ground granulated blast furnace slag and the properties of concrete specimens were investigated. Although it negatively impacts the physical and mechanical properties of concrete at early ages of curing, ground granulated blast furnace slag was found to improve the physical and mechanical properties of concrete up to 45 wt% at later ages. SiO2 nanoparticles with the average particle size of 15 nm were added partially to concrete with the optimum content of ground granulated blast furnace slag and physical and mechanical properties of the specimens were measured. SiO2 nanoparticle as a partial replacement of cement up to 3.0 wt% could accelerate C-S-H gel formation as a result of increased crystalline Ca(OH)2 amount at the early ages and hence increase strength and improve the resistance to water permeability of concrete specimens. The increased SiO2 nanoparticles' content by more than 3.0 wt%, causes the reduced strength because of the decreased crystalline Ca(OH)2 content required for C-S-H gel formation. Several empirical relationships have been presented to predict flexural and split tensile strength of the specimens by means of the corresponding compressive strength at a certain age of curing. Accelerated peak appearance in conduction calorimetry tests, more weight loss in thermogravimetric analysis and more rapid appearance of the peaks related to hydrated products in X-ray diffraction results, all indicate that SiO2 nanoparticles could improve mechanical and physical properties of the concrete specimens.","['SiO2 nanoparticle', 'blast furnace slag']"

Improved strength development and frost resistance of Portland cement ground-granulated blast furnace slag binary binder cured at 0Â Â°C with the addition of calcium silicate hydrate seeds
Abstract:
Cold weather is among the main challenges facing the construction industry in cold regions. Low ambient temperatures retard the early reaction process and strength gain of cementitious materials, thereby increasing the need for heating systems, delaying framework removal, and extending construction schedules. The American Concrete Institute (ACI) defines weather as ""cold weather"" when the air temperature is below 4degC for more than three consecutive days and is not higher than 10degC for 12h. These weather conditions last for at least six months in cold regions, drastically shortening the construction and infrastructure renovation season. This slows down infrastructure and urban development in cold areas considerably.",['blast furnace slag']

Title:
Influence of recycled concrete aggregates on the flexural properties of reinforced alkali activated slag concrete
Abstract:
AbstractAlkali-activated concretes are a novel invention for substituting conventional construction materials; their main variation from conventional Portland cement concretes is utilizing comparatively alkali-rich, clinker-free binder matrix namely alkali-activated slag or geopolymer. Alkali-activated concrete is an environmental friendly and possibly considered to be a part of the sustainable development. Since, aggregates constitutes the major part of the concrete, there is a need to reduce the use of natural aggregate thereby reducing the exploitation of natural resources. This paper explains the influence of recycled concrete aggregates derived from the demolished concrete waste on the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete (GPC). Since, very few studies been conducted using recycled aggregates in geopolymer concrete under ambient curing, an experimental work was carried out involving mixes with varying proportion of recycled aggregates and their influence on the physical, mechanical and flexural characteristics of geopolymer concrete. The results infer that the inclusion of recycled aggregate improves the strength characteristics of geopolymer concrete.","['blast furnace slag', 'demolished concrete waste']"

Title:
Effects of silica fume fineness on mechanical properties of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes subjected to ambient and elevated temperatures exposure
Abstract:
This paper presents the effects of silica fume (SF) fineness and fiber aspect ratios of steel fiber on fresh and harden characteristics of high-strength lightweight concrete containing oil palm shell as coarse aggregates. The effect of elevated temperatures on the residual compressive strength of above concretes is also evaluated in this study. Three different SF fineness of 18 400, 21 000, and 28 000 m2/kg and 2 different aspect ratios of steel fiber of 40 and 80 are considered. Results show that the increase in SF fineness and steel fiber aspect ratio marginally affect the air-dry density of steel fiber reinforced lightweight high-strength concretes, however, the workability is reduced by about 9% to 14% due to increase in SF fineness. The compressive strength of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes at all age increases with increase in SF fineness and an improvement of about 37% is observed at 56 days by increasing the SF fineness from 18 400 to 28 000 m2/kg. Strong correlations are also observed between the strength improvement factor and the SF fineness. Water absorption of above concretes is also reduced by 3% to 14% due to increase of SF fineness from 18 400 to 21 000 and 28 000 m2/kg. The increase of SF fineness also significantly reduces the residual compressive strength loss at 300degC and 450degC. This loss of residual compressive strength is lower in lightweight concretes containing 16 mm long steel fiber than 8 mm long steel fiber. The existing Eurocode model overestimates the residual compressive strength of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes containing no SF, however, this discrepancy is significantly reduced with increase in SF fineness.","['silica fume', 'steel fiber', 'oil palm shell']"

Geopolymer synthetized from bottom coal ash and calcined paper sludge
Abstract:
AbstractThis study deals with the development of geopolymers synthetized from industrial waste containing aluminosilicates. Geopolymers are inorganic polymers formed by the activation of amorphous aluminosilicates (Al2O3.SiO2), which react in a strongly alkaline medium. Bottom ash (SiO2/Al2O3Â =Â 3.3â4.5) was used as source of aluminosilicate and sodium hydroxide (NaOHÂ =Â 5, 10 and 15Â M) and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3, SiO2/Na2OÂ =Â 1.58) were used as alkaline medium. Calcined paper sludge was used to increase the reactivity of the partially crystallized bottom ash. The solid waste was characterized by XRF and XRD and the geopolymer samples were characterized by XRF, XRD, SEM, FTIR and compressive strength tests. The best results were obtained with a solution of 15Â M NaOH and sodium silicate and a mixture of 2:1 bottom ash and calcined paper sludge.","['paper sludge', 'coal bottom ash']"

Biomass fly ash in concrete: Mixture proportioning and mechanical properties
Abstract:
ASTM C 618 prohibits use of biomass fly ashes in concrete. This document compares the properties of biomass fly ashes from cofired (herbaceous with coal), pure wood combustion and blended (pure wood fly ash blended with coal fly ash) to those of coal fly ash in concrete. The results illustrate that with 25% replacement (wt%) of cement by fly ash, the compressive strength (one day to one year) and the flexure strength (at 56th day curing) of cofired and blended biomass fly ash concrete is statistically equal to that of two coal fly ash concrete in this investigation (at 95% confidence interval). This implies that biomass fly ash with co-firing concentration within the concentration interest to commercial coal-biomass co-firing operations at power plants and blended biomass fly ash within a certain blending ratio should be considered in concrete.",['biomass fly ash']

Title:
Chemical activation of blended cements made with lime and natural pozzolans
Abstract:
This paper deals with the chemical activation of lime-pozzolan cement (LPC), which consists of 80% natural pozzolan and 20% hydrated lime (by mass). Results show that the addition of 4% Na2SO4 can significantly improve the early strength of this cement. The presence of 4% flake calcium chloride (CaCl2.2H2O) is not helpful to early strength, but can increase the later strength substantially. CaSO4.O.5H2O and NaCl do not demonstrate an obvious effect on the strength development of the cement. Combination of activators, such as CaCl2.2H2O+Na2SO4 or Na2SO4+NaCl does not improve the activation effect; pastes with 2% Na2SO4+2% NaCl show lower strength than the pastes with 2% Na2SO4 alone.","['natural pozzolan', 'lime']"

This study explores the reaction products of alkali-activated Class C fly ash-based aluminosilicate samples by means of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HSXRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and compressive strength tests to investigate how the readily available aluminum affects the reaction. Class C fly ash-based aluminosilicate raw materials were prepared by incorporating Na-aluminate into the original fly ashes, then alkali-activated by 10M NaOH solution. Incorporating Na-aluminate reduced the compressive strength of samples, with the reduction magnitude relatively constant regardless of length of curing period. The HSXRD provides evidence of the co-existence of CâSâH with geopolymeric gels and strongly suggests that the CâSâH formed in the current system is CâSâH(I). The back-scattered electron images suggest that the CâSâH(I) phase exists as small grains in a finely intermixed form with geopolymeric gels. Despite providing extra source of aluminum, adding Na-aluminate to the mixes did not decrease the Si/Al ratio of the geopolymeric gel.",['Class C fly ash']

Title:
Properties of self-compacting concretes made with binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of fly ash, blast furnace slag, and silica fume
Abstract:
Self-compacting concretes (SCCs) have brought a promising insight into the concrete industry to provide environmental impact and cost reduction. However, the use of ternary and especially quaternary cementitious blends of mineral admixtures have not found sufficient applications in the production of SCCs. For this purpose, an experimental study was conducted to investigate properties of SCCs with mineral admixtures. Moreover, durability based multi-objective optimization of the mixtures were performed to achieve an optimal concrete mixture proportioning. A total of 22 concrete mixtures were designed having a constant water/binder ratio of 0.44 and a total binder content of 450kg/m3. The control mixture included only a Portland cement (PC) as the binder while the remaining mixtures incorporated binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of PC, fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (S), and silica fume (SF). Fresh properties of the SCCs were tested for slump flow diameter, slump flow time, L-box height ratio, and V-funnel flow time. Furthermore, the hardened properties of the concretes were tested for sorptivity, water permeability, chloride permeability, electrical resistivity, drying shrinkage, compressive strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The results indicated that when the durability properties of the concretes were taken into account, the ternary use of S and SF provided the best performance.","['coal fly ash', 'blast furnace slag', 'silica fume']"

Title:
Use of glass and nylon fibers in concrete for controlling early age micro cracking in bridge decks
Abstract:
One of the major defects in concrete bridge decks are the formation of early age micro cracking which ultimately reduces its durability. The inclusion of fibers in concrete slabs has showed satisfactory performance with improved mechanical properties and reduced early age micro cracking (EAMC). The relative high compressive strength (CS), achieved by using high cement content, is the main cause of early age micro cracking in concrete. The low tensile strength (TS) also results in less resistance to early age cracking. Other factors causing EAMC include temperature rise, water content and shrinkage strain. The EAMC can be reduced by increasing CS and TS with use of economical materials other than cement. In this work, mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) and nylon fiber reinforced concrete (NFRC) are determined for the application of concrete bridge decks. The effectiveness of glass fibers (GF) and nylon fibers (NF) in concrete will be checked by comparing mechanical properties of GFRC and NFRC with that of plain concrete (PC). The mix design ratio of PC is 1:3.33:1.67 (cement:sand:aggregate) with a water cement ratio of 0.71. The GF and NF having a length of 50mm and a fiber content of 5%, by mass of cement, are added in the concrete mixture for the production of GFRC and NFRC. Standard specimens are tested for determining compressive, splitting-tensile and flexural strengths of PC, GFRC and NFRC. Pre-crack energy absorption and toughness indices are also studied for different types of loadings i.e. compressive, splitting-tensile and flexural loadings. There is a decrease in compressive strength and an increase in splitting-tensile and flexural strengths of GFRC and NFRC compared to that of PC. Even though pre-crack energy absorption of GFRC and NFRC is less but their toughness indices are more than that of PC. Thus, GFRC and NFRC are suitable for reducing EAMC in bridge decks.","['glass fibre', 'nylon fibre']"

Title:
Properties of lightweight fly ash geopolymer concrete containing bottom ash as aggregates
Abstract:
AbstractIn order to evaluate the utilization of waste from coal combustion thermal power plant, the properties of lightweight geopolymer concrete (LWGC) containing fly ash as geopolymer binder and bottom ash as aggregates were studied. Sodium silicate solution (NS) and 10M sodium hydroxide (NH) were used as alkali activators. The NS/NH ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 with liquid/ash (L/A) ratios of 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80 were used. The compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, surface abrasion resistance, density, thermal conductivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of concrete were tested. The results indicated that fly ash and bottom ash could be used to produce LWGCs with compressive strengths of 14.3â18.1MPa, splitting tensile strengths of 1.2â2.0MPa, and densities of 1661â1688kg/m3. Theirs thermal conductivity coefficients of 0.43â0.47W/mK were lower than those of the geopolymer concrete containing natural aggregate. LWGCs in this study could thus be used for moderate strength concrete and thermal insulation concrete.","['coal fly ash', 'coal bottom ash']"

Title:
A preliminary study of manufacture of cement from rice husk ash
Abstract:
Cement has been successfully produced from the agricultural waste, rice husk ash. For this production, rice husk was pre-carbonized in a pilot-plant and was further decarbonized in an electric furnace to produce rice husk ash. 24.5% rice husk ash was mixed with other raw materials (sourced locally) for producing white Portland cement and the cement produced was used to make a concrete slab. The formulated cement slab, commercial cement and slab were tested for their physical characteristics and chemical composition. The results of tests confirmed that produced cement was of similar standard to commercial cement. Based on the results, the production of cement from rice husk has been recommended for developing countries since it would help reduce problems of rice husks as farm wastes.",['rice husk ash']

Title:
Geopolymerisation of silt generated from construction and demolition waste washing plants
Abstract:
Recycling plants that size, sort and wash construction and demolition waste can produce high quality aggregate. However, they also produce up to 80 ton per hour of filter cake waste containing fine (<63 mm) silt particles that is classified as inert waste and normally landfilled. This research investigated the potential to form geopolymers containing silt, which would allow this problematic waste to be beneficially reused as aggregate. This would significantly improve the economic viability of recycling plants that wash wastes. Silt filter cakes have been collected from a number of aggregate washing plants operating in the UK. These were found to contain similar aluminosilicate crystalline phases. Geopolymer samples were produced using silt and silt mixed with either metakaolin or pulverised fuel ash (PFA). Silt geopolymers cured at room temperature had average 7-day compressive strengths of 18.7 MPa, while partial substitution of silt by metakaolin or PFA increased average compressive strengths to 30.5 and 21.9 MPa, respectively. Curing specimens for 24 h at 105 degC resulted in a compressive strength of 39.7 MPa and microstructural analysis confirmed the formation of dense materials. These strengths are in excess of those required for materials to be used as aggregate, particularly in unbound applications. The implications of this research for the management of waste silt at construction and demolition waste washing plants are discussed.","['construction and demolition waste', 'metakaolin', 'coal fly ash']"

Title:
Effect of silica fume and fly ash on hydration and microstructure evolution of cement based composites at low waterâbinder ratios
Abstract:
The hydration process of ultra-high performance cementitious composite (UHPCC) is distinctly different from common concrete owing to its low water-binder ratio (w/b). The effects of silica fume and fly ash on the hydration process and microstructure were investigated via different characterization methods in this work. The results indicated that the hydration process could be accelerated at the beginning by addition of silica fume, and fly ash, on the other h, retarded hydration mainly in the dormant and acceleration periods. When they were incorporated together in cement, the result differed significantly from cement hydration at higher w/b (>0.35). As a result of Ca(OH)2 consumption by pozzolanic reaction, the porosity reduced (<4%) and the interface strengthened as the curing time increased. Nanoindentation results revealed that most hydration products of UHPCC were UHD C-S-H and unhydrated cement. The unhydrated cement particles were surrounded by UHD C-S-H, implying that the UHPCC had excellent mechanical performance and durability.The material of interest is:

Durability of very high volume fly ash cement pastes and mortars in aggressive solutions
Abstract:
The resistance of very high volume fly ash cement pastes and mortars activated by Na2SO4 has been monitored following immersion for up to 90d in 0.1M HCl, 4.4% Na2SO4 and ASTM-compliant sea water. Changes in the compressive strengths of mortars and in crystalline phases, bond environments, and the microstructure of pastes following immersion were monitored. Experiments were repeated with a commercially available sulfate resistant cement. Both cements were found to present adequate resistance to both sea water and the Na2SO4 solution. However, both were severely degraded by acid immersion. Differences in potential degradation mechanisms based on the chemistry of the fly ash binder and the reference cement are discussed.The material of interest is:

Title:
Synergistic utilization of red mud for flue-gas desulfurization and fly ash-based geopolymer preparation
Abstract:
As an industrial waste characterized by huge volume and high alkalinity, red mud has become a serious environmental problem. The reuse of red mud has been explored in previous studies, including as building materials and for soil and waste water treatment. In this study, an innovation was made for the reuse of red mud to create a synergistic effect. Red mud was first used in flue gas desulfurization (FGD), and then the desulfurized red mud was again reused to make a geopolymer material. By using one type of original red mud and three types of fly ash, this study revealed that with high alkalinity and desulfurization capacity, the red mud could serve as an excellent FGD sorbent. After FGD, the sodium sulfate in the desulfurized red mud acted as a chemical activator for geopolymer made with class C fly ash. A 25% increase in strength was observed between the geopolymers with the red mud after FGD and with the original one. There are no significant benefits of FGD on the class F fly ash-based geopolymers and further study is required.The material of interest is:

Blending of industrial waste from different sources as partial substitution of Portland cement in pastes and mortars
Abstract:
Binary and ternary combinations of sewage sludge ash (SSA) with marble dust (MD), fly ash (FA) and rice husk ash (RHA) as replacement in Portland cement pastes, were assessed. Several tests were carried out at different curing ages: thermogravimetry, density, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity and mechanical strengths. Pozzolanic effects of the mineral admixtures, densities similar to control sample and improved absorptions when combining waste materials were identified. In general, the compressive strength reaches or exceeds the cement strength class, and blending SSA, FA and RHA (30% cement replacement) increase of strength by 9%, compared to the control sample, was achieved.The material of interest is:

Title:
Preparation of the saving-energy sulphoaluminate cement using MSWI fly ash
Abstract:
MSWI fly ash was used as a major cement raw material in sintering sulphoaluminate cement clinker successfully in the laboratory. Sintering system, mechanical performance, hydration process and microstructure of the clinker was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), etc. The result shows that the clinker can be sintered properly under the temperature of 1200-1300 degC and sintered time of 120 min. Cl- content in the clinker made with MSWI fly ash is about 1.08%. However most Cl- cannot leach out in water solution from the hardened cement paste during curing age between 1 d and 28 d because of the Cl- being combined in clinker minerals and its hydrates. The compressive strength of the sulphoaluminate cement was high in early age while that developed smoothly in later age.The material of interest is:

Title:
Performance of self-compacting concrete containing fly ash
Abstract:
The influence of including fly ash (FA) on the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) is investigated. Portland cement (PC) was partially replaced with 0-80% FA. The water to binder ratio was maintained at 0.36 for all mixes. Properties included workability, compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (V), absorption and shrinkage. The results indicate that high volume FA can be used in SCC to produce high strength and low shrinkage. Replacing 40% of PC with FA resulted in a strength of more than 65N/mm2at 56days. High absorption values are obtained with increasing amount of FA, however, all FA concrete exhibits absorption of less than 2%. There is a systematic reduction in shrinkage as the FA content increases and at 80% FA content, the shrinkage at 56days reduced by two third compared with the control. A linear relationship exists between the 56 day shrinkage and FA content. Increasing the admixture content beyond a certain level leads to a reduction in strength and increase in absorption. The correlation between strength and absorption indicates that there is sharp decrease in strength as absorption increases from 1 to 2%. After 2% absorption, the strength reduces at a much slower rate.The material of interest is:

Title:
Chemical interactions between siliceous aggregates and low-Ca alkali-activated cements
Abstract:
The chemical interactions between natural siliceous aggregates and a low-Ca alkali-activated cement (geopolymer) were studied. By leaching ideal aluminosilicate minerals such as kaolinite and albite in various alkaline solutions with or without soluble silicates, it was found that addition of 0.5M SiO2 to a highly alkaline activating solution ([OH-]0=5 to 10M) was responsible for the formation of an Al-enriched aluminosilicate surface through the initial non-stoichiometric and Si preferential dissolution of the parent aluminosilicates. This then facilitated soluble silicate deposition from the activating solutions onto the Al-rich surfaces, which resulted in the formation of a dense deposited aluminosilicate gel interfacial layer. This aluminosilicate interface formed during albite leaching ([OH-]0=5 to 10M and [SiO2]0=0.5M) was found to possess a similar Si/Al ratio to the real interface between a siliceous aggregate slice (basalt or siltstone) and a low-Ca fly ash/kaolinite geopolymer, activated with an activating solution of [OH-]0=10M and [SiO2]0=2.5M. Due to the similarities between the activating solutions used and the interfaces formed, it is postulated that a similar formation mechanism is shared between the deposited aluminosilicate interface formed from leaching and a 'real' geopolymer concrete synthesis. Without soluble silicate addition, or if a solution of low alkalinity ([OH-]0=0.6M and [SiO2]0=0 and 0.5M) was used, the Al-enriched reacting surface was not formed, and no deposited aluminosilicate interface was observed in these systems.The material of interest is:

Title:
Properties of self-compacting concretes made with binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of fly ash, blast furnace slag, and silica fume
Abstract:
Self-compacting concretes (SCCs) have brought a promising insight into the concrete industry to provide environmental impact and cost reduction. However, the use of ternary and especially quaternary cementitious blends of mineral admixtures have not found sufficient applications in the production of SCCs. For this purpose, an experimental study was conducted to investigate properties of SCCs with mineral admixtures. Moreover, durability based multi-objective optimization of the mixtures were performed to achieve an optimal concrete mixture proportioning. A total of 22 concrete mixtures were designed having a constant water/binder ratio of 0.44 and a total binder content of 450kg/m3. The control mixture included only a Portland cement (PC) as the binder while the remaining mixtures incorporated binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of PC, fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (S), and silica fume (SF). Fresh properties of the SCCs were tested for slump flow diameter, slump flow time, L-box height ratio, and V-funnel flow time. Furthermore, the hardened properties of the concretes were tested for sorptivity, water permeability, chloride permeability, electrical resistivity, drying shrinkage, compressive strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The results indicated that when the durability properties of the concretes were taken into account, the ternary use of S and SF provided the best performance.The material of interest is:

Title:
Properties of geopolymer with seeded fly ash and rice husk bark ash
Abstract:
In the present work, compressive strength of inorganic polymers (geopolymers) produced of seeded fly ash and rice husk bark ash has been investigated. Different specimens made from a mixture of fly ash and rice husk bark ash in fine and coarse form were subjected to compressive strength tests at 7 and 28 days of curing. The curing regime was different: one set of the specimens were cured at room temperature until reaching to 7 and 28 days and the other sets were oven cured for 36h at the range of 40-90degC and then cured at room temperature until 7 and 28 days. The results indicate that in both 7 and 28 days regimes, the highest strengths are related to the specimens by SiO2/Al2O3 ratio equals 2.99 cured at 80degC. For these specimens, those contained finer fly ash particles show more compressive strength. Thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy both also are in agreement with the obtained results from compressive strength tests. In addition, SEM micrographs of the specimens show that the finer the particle size of the utilized ashes, the denser the microstructure which confirms the results obtained by the strength tests.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effect of chemical composition of slag on chloride penetration resistance of concrete
Abstract:
Three ground granulated slags (FeMn arc-furnace (GGAS), Corex (GGCS) and blastfurnace (GGBS) slags) of varying chemical composition, and from different sources were used to make concretes using two w/b ratios (0.40 and 0.60) and three slag replacement levels (20%, 35% and 50%). The effect of chemical composition and replacement level of slags on the chloride penetration resistance of the concretes was assessed using the chloride conductivity test. The results showed that the chloride penetration resistance of concrete increases with decreasing w/b ratio and increasing slag replacement level. In the GGAS concretes, despite having relatively low SiO2 and high MgO content, its significantly high Mn2O3 and low Al2O3 content was found to have a negative effect on the chloride penetration resistance of the concrete. The significantly high chloride penetration resistance of GGCS concretes was partly attributed to both its high CaO content and particle fineness. Only GGCS concretes showed a trend of increasing chloride penetration resistance with increased particle fineness; GGBS and GGAS concretes did not show any trend between particle fineness and chloride penetration resistance. The slag activity index was found to be a better indicator of chloride penetration resistance in concrete than the slag hydraulic index.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effects of silica fume fineness on mechanical properties of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes subjected to ambient and elevated temperatures exposure
Abstract:
This paper presents the effects of silica fume (SF) fineness and fiber aspect ratios of steel fiber on fresh and harden characteristics of high-strength lightweight concrete containing oil palm shell as coarse aggregates. The effect of elevated temperatures on the residual compressive strength of above concretes is also evaluated in this study. Three different SF fineness of 18 400, 21 000, and 28 000 m2/kg and 2 different aspect ratios of steel fiber of 40 and 80 are considered. Results show that the increase in SF fineness and steel fiber aspect ratio marginally affect the air-dry density of steel fiber reinforced lightweight high-strength concretes, however, the workability is reduced by about 9% to 14% due to increase in SF fineness. The compressive strength of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes at all age increases with increase in SF fineness and an improvement of about 37% is observed at 56 days by increasing the SF fineness from 18 400 to 28 000 m2/kg. Strong correlations are also observed between the strength improvement factor and the SF fineness. Water absorption of above concretes is also reduced by 3% to 14% due to increase of SF fineness from 18 400 to 21 000 and 28 000 m2/kg. The increase of SF fineness also significantly reduces the residual compressive strength loss at 300degC and 450degC. This loss of residual compressive strength is lower in lightweight concretes containing 16 mm long steel fiber than 8 mm long steel fiber. The existing Eurocode model overestimates the residual compressive strength of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes containing no SF, however, this discrepancy is significantly reduced with increase in SF fineness.The material of interest is:

Title:
Study on solids-to-liquid and alkaline activator ratios on kaolin-based geopolymers
Abstract:
Kaolin and alkali activator were mixed with the solids-to-liquid ratios in range of 0.60-1.20 (Al2O3/Na2O molar ratio of 0.63-1.27). Sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide ranged between 0.16 and 0.36 (SiO2/Na2O molar ratio of 3.19-3.67) were mixed together to prepare alkali activator. The results concluded that compressive strength was affected by both S/L and Na2SiO3/NaOH ratios and strength increased with ageing day. Both these ratio also influenced the workability of the mixes. Besides, the kaolin geopolymers showed good volume stability in water. Compressive strength was highest at S/L and Na2SiO3/NaOH ratios of 1.00 and 0.32, respectively. In term of molar ratios, optimum was achieved at Al2O3/Na2O of 1.09 and SiO2/Na2O molar ratios of 3.58. Microstructures showed that kaolin particles were slightly activated with large part of unreacted raw materials remained in the system. Geopolymer sample reduced in peak intensities over time as presented by XRD analysis and the presence of crystalline peaks in the kaolin geopolymers was Zeolite X. FTIR analysis showed the presence of geopolymer bonding increased over age. In overall, kaolin geopolymers does not undergo complete geopolymerization and showed slow strength development. Vast research works have to be carried out to further improve the properties of kaolin geopolymers.The material of interest is:

Abstract:
Binary and ternary combinations of sewage sludge ash (SSA) with marble dust (MD), fly ash (FA) and rice husk ash (RHA) as replacement in Portland cement pastes, were assessed. Several tests were carried out at different curing ages: thermogravimetry, density, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity and mechanical strengths. Pozzolanic effects of the mineral admixtures, densities similar to control sample and improved absorptions when combining waste materials were identified.

Title:
The effect of waste rubber particles and silica fume on the mechanical properties of Roller Compacted Concrete Pavement
Abstract:
The current investigation discusses the potential use of recycled tire rubbers in roller compacted concrete pavement with the purpose of both improving its performance and reducing its environmental impacts. The main focus was on the basic properties of the roller compacted concrete, including the unit weight, the compressive strength, the flexural strength, and the water absorption of samples; thus, the particles of used tires were utilized as a replacement for the sand aggregate by 0, 5%, 10% ... and 35%. Also, the silica fume additive was used as a replacement for the cement material in eight mixes. The main point is that fresh specimens were compacted by a hammer, not a vibrator, in order to reach a homogeneous concrete. The results of the study showed an increase in the compressive strength of 28 days for different rubber contents 5% and 10%, without silica fume, and 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, with silica fume; however, the compressive strength was reduced for the other samples in comparison with the control specimen. Correspondingly, there was an increase in the flexural strength of 28 days for samples containing of 5% crumb rubber, with and without silica fume, although the flexural strength decreased for the other mixtures. Furthermore, the findings of the present investigation showed that the replacement of the sand by the used tire particles reduces water absorption, and this decrease was more obvious for samples with silica fume. In the final analysis, a regression model was defined to find a relationship between compressive and flexural strengths.The material of interest is:

Mixture Design of Experiment (DOE) was utilized, with analysis of compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, hydraulic properties, cost, CO2 production, and energy consumption. Models were derived to understand the impact of mix design on performance and for optimization. Successful formulations are hydraulic and cure at room temperature, with strengths as high as 41MPa at 3d and 65MPa at 28d. These formulations, compared to OPC, are competitive in cost and performance and can reduce both CO2 production and energy consumption by up to 97%.The material of interest is:

Diffusion of chloride ions in limestone filler blended cement pastes and mortars
Abstract:
The diffusion of chloride ions in neat cement pastes and mortars made with and without a limestone filler was investigated. In order to study the effect of the limestone filler, all mixtures were prepared at a fixed ratio (0,55). Test results indicate that the addition of a limestone filler reduces the diffusion coefficient of chloride ions. This reduction is attributed to the effect of the limestone filler particles on the tortuosity of the system. Results also indicate that the presence of interfaces has only a limited effect on the diffusion coefficient of chloride ions.The material of interest is:

Behavior of high strength fly ash concrete columns under fire conditions
Abstract:
Fly ash concrete is finding increasing applications in construction; however there is lack of data on fire performance of fly ash concrete structural members. This paper presents results from fire resistance tests on fly ash concrete columns. Data generated from tests on high strength fly ash concrete columns is compared with those of conventional high strength concrete (HSC) columns. The effect of concrete type, fire exposure scenario, fly ash, and fibers in concrete mix on fire performance of fly ash concrete columns is discussed. Results from fire resistance tests show that fly ash concrete columns exhibit almost similar fire resistance to that of conventional HSC columns. Further, the addition of polypropylene fibers mitigates fire induced spalling in high strength fly ash concrete columns.The material of interest is:

Experimental study on the mechanical and thermal properties of basalt fiber and nanoclay reinforced polymer concrete
Abstract:
This paper describes the investigation of the synthesis and improvement of the mechanical properties of quaternary epoxy-based polymer concrete (PC) using basalt fiber and clay nanoparticles. First, the effect of chopped basalt fiber on the compressive, flexural, splitting tensile and impact strengths as well as the effect of different temperatures (up to 250 degC) on the strength of fiber reinforced PC were investigated experimentally. Basalt fiber improved the mechanical properties and increased the thermal stability of PC. In the next step, the effect of nanoclay particles on the mechanical properties and the effect of high temperatures (up to 250 degC) on the strength of basalt fiber-reinforced PC (BFRPC) were analyzed experimentally. Nanoparticles increase the compressive, flexural and impact strength as well as the thermal stability but decrease the tensile strength of the PC. SEM analysis was performed to study the fracture surface and morphology of various concrete specimens. The resulting polymer nanocomposite will be used as a lightweight polymer concrete with high mechanical strength and thermal stability.The material of interest is:

Title:
Evaluation of tire rubber surface pre-treatment and silica fume on physical-mechanical behavior and microstructural properties of concrete
Abstract:
The increasing accumulation of tire waste has become a social environmental and public health problem because rubber degradation is extremely difficult to achieve and time consuming. The incorporation of rubber waste in concrete has become a recourse to assist in the disposal of this solid waste. This investigation evaluated the influence of a chemical pretreatment with sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) on the physical, mechanical, microstructural properties of concretes with two rubber residue contents (15% and 30%) as a natural fine aggregate replacement, and the addition of silica fume (7.5% and 15%) to replace Portland cement. X-ray microtomography and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the influence of treatment rubber and silica fume in the microstructure of concretes. The use of rubber in the cement matrix, regardless of the treatment (or lack thereof), decreases the concrete density (lower 10.5%) and compressive strength at 28d (54%), besides the increase the porosity (18%) than reference concretes. The rubber pre-treatment did not significantly influence the concrete behavior. In contrast, the use of silica fume showed significant compressive strength gains, up to 80% for concretes with 30% of rubber replacement at 28 days. These gains were confirmed by the microstructural analysis and the densification of the interfacial transition zone.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effect of silica fume on durability of self-compacting concrete made with waste recycled concrete aggregates
Abstract:
Due to adhered mortar in recycled concrete aggregates, some of the properties of concrete made with these types of aggregates, such as water absorption, porosity, electrical resistivity, and chloride ion penetration, may be affected. In this study, silica fume was used as a part of cementitious materials to improve the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC), which were made with fine and coarse recycled aggregates. Three series of mixtures were made in the laboratory. In the first and second series, coarse recycled aggregates with replacement of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% were used with and without silica fume. In the third series, 25% of fine recycled aggregates were replaced with fine natural aggregates. Slump flow and J-ring tests were considered for fresh state of SCC. The compressive strength, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity, electrical resistivity, and chloride ion penetration tests were performed for hardened concrete. The use of silica fume improved the properties of fresh SCC. The results showed that silica fume can reduce water absorption and porosity. The silica fume showed that can resulted in a significant increase in electrical resistivity. On the other h, the replacement of 25% of recycled aggregates did not have a significant effect on electrical resistivity, the electrical resistivity decreased by increasing the amount of replacement. Silica fume was very effective in controlling chloride ion penetration and reducing total charge passed. Silica fume also controlled the temperature of the solutions used during the test which indicates the control of the movement of ions in the penetration into concrete.The material of interest is:

X-ray microtomography and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the influence of treatment rubber and silica fume in the microstructure of concretes. The use of rubber in the cement matrix, regardless of the treatment (or lack thereof), decreases the concrete density (lower 10.5%) and compressive strength at 28d (54%), besides the increase the porosity (18%) than reference concretes. The rubber pre-treatment did not significantly influence the concrete behavior. In contrast, the use of silica fume showed significant compressive strength gains, up to 80% for concretes with 30% of rubber replacement at 28 days. These gains were confirmed by the microstructural analysis and the densification of the interfacial transition zone.The material of interest is:

Title:
Statistical models for the development of optimized furnace slag lightweight aggregate self-consolidating concrete
Abstract:
AbstractThis investigation aims to develop robust lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC) mixtures with furnace slag (FS) aggregates. A factorial design was carried out to mathematically model the influence of three key mix design parameters on fresh and hardened properties of furnace slag LWSCC (FS-LWSCC) mixtures. The parameters were water to binder ratio (w/b), high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA) content and total binder content. The responses of the derived statistical models were slump flow, V-funnel flow time, J-ring flow diameter/height difference, L-box ratio, filling capacity, sieve segregation, unit weight and compressive strength. Twenty mixes were prepared to derive the statistical models, and ten mixes were used to verify the accuracy of the developed models. The models were valid for mixes made with 0.30â0.40 w/b, HRWRA of 0.3â1.2% (by total binder content), and 410 to 550kg/m3 of total binder content. The influences of w/b, HRWRA% and total binder content were characterized and analyzed using regression technique to identify the primary factors and their interactions on the measured properties. Utilizing the developed models, three optimum FS-LWSCC mixtures with high statistical desirability were formulated and tested. It was possible to produce robust FS-LWSCCs that satisfy European EFNARC criteria.The material of interest is:

Title:
Preparation of sulphoaluminate belite cement from fly ash
Abstract:
Sulphoaluminate belite cements containing the phases C2S, C4A3 S, C4AF, CS were synthesised from limestone, fly ash and gypsum at 1200 degC. The correspondence between the predicted phase composition and real phase composition were checked. The influence of quantities of different phases in the hydration behaviour and strength development were verified. Results show that an optimum proportion of phase quantities help in high strenght development in early age. These cements fulfill all the requirement of Portland cement and have very high early strength. Porosity measurements show that the total pore volume in early period is comparatively less than that of Ordinary Portland Cement. Thus these cements can be usable for special purposes.The material of interest is:

Title:
Investigation of the chemical, strength, adhesion and morphological properties of fly ash based geopolymer-modified bitumen
Abstract:
The current study seeks to investigate the chemical, strength, adhesion and morphological properties of fly-ash based geopolymer-modified bitumen (GMB). The geopolymer was prepared by mixing class F fly ash with alkaline solution (sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide), and was then mixed with an 80/100 penetration grade bitumen at different concentrations of 3, 5, 7 and 9% (by weight of bitumen) to produce the GMB. The chemical and strength properties of the binders were determined using the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Impact tests, respectively. The Surface Free Energy (SFE) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tests were conducted to establish the adhesion and morphology of the binders. The modification of base bitumen with geopolymer resulting the improvement in structural chain mobility properties and improved storage stability compared to those of the control sample. The result of FTIR analysis showed that the incorporation of geopolymer into base bitumen did not cause any change in the functional groups, where the peaks of aromatic C C stretching is at around 1600cm-1 (stretch), 1475cm-1 (stretch) and 900-600cm-1 (out-of-plane bend). The peak at around 1390cm-1 clearly shows the stretch of the C-N amine group. The result of SFE test shows that GMB has better resistance to moisture damage. Finally, the AFM analysis revealed morphological changes in all GMB samples. In general, the addition of 5% geopolymer can be considered as is the optimum concentration for bitumen modification.The material of interest is:

Title:
Enhancing the thermal performance of Class F fly ash-based geopolymer by sodalite
Abstract:
Increased awareness and demand for fire safety of buildings are promoting research on fire-resistant materials, especially inorganic-based materials. One recent focus is geopolymers thanks to their high corrosion (acidic attack) and high-temperature resistance [1-3], in addition to their considerably eco-friendly characteristics. Geopolymers are formed by alkaline activation of aluminosilicate sources such as fly ash [4-5]. The lower water demand of fly ash-based geopolymers benefits in minimizing the damage caused by water evaporation during high-temperature exposure. Furthermore, compared to metakaolin-based geopolymers continuous sintering of fly ash particles triggered particle binding and strength increase with temperature increase. The aluminosilicate gel contributes essentially towards the high-temperature performance. However, geopolymers also release the physically and chemically bound water at elevated temperatures, which can destabilize the material structure and cause the thermal shrinkage and crack formation. Besides, the vapor pressure produced by both the physically and chemically absorbed water within the matrix will attempt to escape at elevated temperature. Thus, the level of thermally-induced damage is highly dependent on the pore structure of the material. Moreover, the research conducted by Ozawa and Shaikh showed that pure fly ash-based geopolymer did not exhibit the abrupt decrease in vapour pressure reported in cement-based and fly ash/slag-based materials, resulting in spalling and cracks, which may also demonstrate the advantageous utilization of fly ash in synthesis of geopolymer. Taking into account the enormous influence of the microstructure on geopolymer thermal degradation, the research focusing on the improvement of the matrix in order to address these issues is of great significance.The material of interest is:

Title:
Durability properties of high volume fly ash self compacting concretes
Abstract:
This paper presents an experimental study on the durability properties of self compacting concretes (SCCs) with high volume replacements of fly ash. Eight fly ash self compacting concretes of various strength grades were designed at desired fly ash percentages of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 85%, in comparison with five different mixtures of normal vibrated concretes (NCs) at equivalent strength grades. The durability properties were studied through the measurement of permeable voids, water absorption, acid attack and chloride permeation. The results indicated that the SCCs showed higher permeable voids and water absorption than the vibrated normal concretes of the same strength grades. However, in acid attack and chloride diffusion studies the high volume fly ash SCCs had significantly lower weight losses and chloride ion diffusion.The material of interest is:

Title:
Stabilization of Recycled Demolition Aggregates by Geopolymers comprising Calcium Carbide Residue, Fly Ash and Slag precursors
Abstract:
Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) is the by-product of acetylene gas production. In this research, the alkali activation of Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) was studied as an economical and low-carbon precursor for development of geopolymer binder. Recycled Concrete aggregates (RCA) and Crushed Brick (CB) are the two major demolition material sources for the Construction and Demolition (C&D) industry. The cement stabilization of C&D materials has been evaluated in recent years, however due to the large carbon footprint associated with Portland cement, geopolymers which utilize the alkali activation of industrial waste by-products have garnered increasing interest from industry. Evaluation of the geopolymer stabilization of C&D materials with CCR precursor were also compared with traditional Fly Ash (FA) and Slag (S) precursors. In addition, the performance of CCR based geopolymers with supplementary FA and S precursors were also evaluated. The three precursors (CCR, FA, S) were combined with contents of up to 10% for the geopolymer stabilization of the C&D materials. A liquid alkaline activator comprising sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used for the alkali activation of the CCR based geopolymers. The strength and durability of the geopolymer stabilized C&D materials were evaluated to ascertain their application in pavement bases/subbases. The results of Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Resilient Modulus (MR) testing of these geopolymer stabilized CB and RCA aggregates indicate that different mixtures of CCR based geopolymers can be used to improve the strength properties of the C&D aggregates for pavement base/subbase applications. CCR + 5% S with the C&D materials resulted in the optimum combination for CCR based geopolymer stabilization of C&D aggregates.The material of interest is:

Title:
Properties of self-compacting concretes made with binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of fly ash, blast furnace slag, and silica fume
Abstract:
Self-compacting concretes (SCCs) have brought a promising insight into the concrete industry to provide environmental impact and cost reduction. However, the use of ternary and especially quaternary cementitious blends of mineral admixtures have not found sufficient applications in the production of SCCs. For this purpose, an experimental study was conducted to investigate properties of SCCs with mineral admixtures. Moreover, durability based multi-objective optimization of the mixtures were performed to achieve an optimal concrete mixture proportioning. A total of 22 concrete mixtures were designed having a constant water/binder ratio of 0.44 and a total binder content of 450kg/m3. The control mixture included only a Portland cement (PC) as the binder while the remaining mixtures incorporated binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of PC, fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (S), and silica fume (SF). Fresh properties of the SCCs were tested for slump flow diameter, slump flow time, L-box height ratio, and V-funnel flow time. Furthermore, the hardened properties of the concretes were tested for sorptivity, water permeability, chloride permeability, electrical resistivity, drying shrinkage, compressive strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The results indicated that when the durability properties of the concretes were taken into account, the ternary use of S and SF provided the best performance.The material of interest is:

Title:
Influence of recycled concrete aggregates on the flexural properties of reinforced alkali activated slag concrete
Abstract:
AbstractAlkali-activated concretes are a novel invention for substituting conventional construction materials; their main variation from conventional Portland cement concretes is utilizing comparatively alkali-rich, clinker-free binder matrix namely alkali-activated slag or geopolymer. Alkali-activated concrete is an environmental friendly and possibly considered to be a part of the sustainable development. Since, aggregates constitutes the major part of the concrete, there is a need to reduce the use of natural aggregate thereby reducing the exploitation of natural resources. This paper explains the influence of recycled concrete aggregates derived from the demolished concrete waste on the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete (GPC). Since, very few studies been conducted using recycled aggregates in geopolymer concrete under ambient curing, an experimental work was carried out involving mixes with varying proportion of recycled aggregates and their influence on the physical, mechanical and flexural characteristics of geopolymer concrete. The results infer that the inclusion of recycled aggregate improves the strength characteristics of geopolymer concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
A review on different methods of activating tailings to improve their cementitious property as cemented paste and reusability
Abstract:
Over the past few decades, as demand for minerals and metals has increased, the amount and volume of wastes and tailings has also increased dramatically. The management and reuse of mineral wastes and tailings not only help protect the environment but also are properly associated with economic benefits. As a result, mineral processing wastes disposal and storage has become a global issue. Along with the use of cemented paste as a backfill in underground spaces, the use of mineral processing wastes in the construction industry or as a substitute for cement is one of the new approaches to mineral tailings management. It is worth noting that the cement industry is facing crucial environmental issues. Portland cement production in industries increases the greenhouse effect and creates acidic rain. In fact, it generates greenhouse gases directly through carbon dioxide emission during clinker production as well as through energy consumption. In addition, the increasing stringency of environmental regulations has forced the mining industries to make efforts in order to manage tailings. One of the new and attractive techniques to reduce environmental problems and to obtain economic and technological benefits is to increase the use of tailings, for example, the use of mineral tailings as a substitute for cement. It is important to note that mineral tailings are not normally cemented and are accompanied by reduced strength of cement and concrete mortars; thus, there is a need for methods to increase their cementitious properties. Activation is one of the methods improving cementitious/pozzolanic properties of mineral tailings. Therefore, the present review study aimed to investigate the activation methods to improve the properties of tailings resulted from minerals processing in order to be used as a replacement for cement, to reduce the pollution caused by cement production, as well as to reduce the volume of unused mineral tailings. Different physical, chemical, and thermal activation methods were examined, and criticisms and research gaps of previous studies were presented.The material of interest is:

Title:
Geopolymerisation of silt generated from construction and demolition waste washing plants
Abstract:
Recycling plants that size, sort and wash construction and demolition waste can produce high quality aggregate. However, they also produce up to 80 ton per hour of filter cake waste containing fine (<63 mm) silt particles that is classified as inert waste and normally landfilled. This research investigated the potential to form geopolymers containing silt, which would allow this problematic waste to be beneficially reused as aggregate. This would significantly improve the economic viability of recycling plants that wash wastes. Silt filter cakes have been collected from a number of aggregate washing plants operating in the UK. These were found to contain similar aluminosilicate crystalline phases. Geopolymer samples were produced using silt and silt mixed with either metakaolin or pulverised fuel ash (PFA). Silt geopolymers cured at room temperature had average 7-day compressive strengths of 18.7 MPa, while partial substitution of silt by metakaolin or PFA increased average compressive strengths to 30.5 and 21.9 MPa, respectively. Curing specimens for 24 h at 105 degC resulted in a compressive strength of 39.7 MPa and microstructural analysis confirmed the formation of dense materials. These strengths are in excess of those required for materials to be used as aggregate, particularly in unbound applications. The implications of this research for the management of waste silt at construction and demolition waste washing plants are discussed.The material of interest is:

Title:
Influence and mechanism of micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of concrete
Abstract:
The abrasion resistances of concrete in which the cement was partially replaced by 40 wt% super fine slag (SFS), 5 wt% nano-SiO2 (NS), 5 wt% NS and 25 wt% fly ash (FA) were tested. Mechanisms responsible for the affection of these micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of the concrete were analyzed through measurements of the micro-hardness of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of the aggregate-cement matrix and the cement matrix, the hydration products of the paste, and the degree of polymerization of the silicate chains of C-S-H in the paste. Results indicated that the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA improved the abrasion resistance of the surface mortar layer by 82%, 73% and 68%, respectively, and that of the concrete by 20%, 16% and 13%, respectively. Because of the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA, Ca(OH)2 was consumed to produce more calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and other aluminiferous hydration products, and the degree of polymerization of silicate chains in C-S-H was increased. Therefore, the micro-mechanical properties of the ITZ and the cement matrix were strengthened, improving the abrasion resistance of the concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Mechanical Fracture Parameters of Cement Based Mortars with Waste Glass Powder
Abstract:
Glass is an amorphous solid substance with pozzolanic properties that can be used as a partial substitute for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in cement based composites. In the research conducted for this paper, the PC was partially replaced by fine-ground waste laboratory borosilicate glass (in mixtures where 5, 10, 15 and 20% by mass was substituted). Beam specimens with the dimensions 40 x 40 x 160 mm were prepared from each mixture. After demoulding, the specimens were kept under standard laboratory conditions. Basic tests were conducted at the age of 7, 28, 56, and 90 days: the compressive (f c) and flexural (f f) strengths were determined according to the CSN EN 1015-11 standard. Specimens were also subjected to fracture testing at the age of 28 days. The beam specimens with an initial central edge notch were tested in three-point bending. Load vs. displacement diagrams were recorded and modulus of elasticity (E), fracture toughness (K Ic e) and fracture energy (G F *) were determined. It was found, that strength increased with specimen age: at the age 28 days this increase was 12-33% in case of f c, and 6-15% as regards f f. The values obtained for almost all the parameters decreased with the increasing dosage of glass as a replacement for cement: compared to a reference composite this decrease was 22-40% in the case of f c, 24-28% for f f, 3-5% for E, 9-29% for K Ic e, and 30-50% for G F *; exceptions were recorded for glass replacement doses of 5 and 10%, where increases of 2-6% for f c and 8-10% for E were obtained.The material of interest is:

Title:
Recycling steel-manufacturing slag and harbor sediment into construction materials
Abstract:
Mixtures consisting of harbor sediment and slag waste from steel industry containing toxic components are fired to produce non-hazardous construction materials. The fired pellets become lighter as firing temperature increases. At a sintering temperature of <=1050 degC, the fired pellets are in a form of brick-like product, while at 1100 degC, they become lightweight aggregates. Calcium silicate, kyanite, and cristobalite are newly formed in the pellets after firing, demonstrating that calcium oxide acts as a flux component and chemically reacted with Si- and/or Al-containing components to promote sintering. Dioxin/furan content present in the pure slag is 0.003 ng I-TEQ g-1, for the fired pellet consisting of slag and sediment, the content appears to be destructed and diminishes to 0.0003 ng I-TEQ g-1 after 950 degC-firing; while it is 0.002 ng I-TEQ g-1 after firing at 1100 degC, suggesting that dioxins/furans in the 950 degC-fired pellets have a greater chance to escape to atmosphere due to a slower sintering reaction and/or that construction of dioxins/furans from molten chloride salts co-exists with their destruction. Multiple toxicity characteristic leaching procedure extracts Cu, Cr, Zn, Se, Cd, Pb, Ba, As, and Hg from all fired products at negligible levels.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effect of chemical composition of slag on chloride penetration resistance of concrete
Abstract:
Three ground granulated slags (FeMn arc-furnace (GGAS), Corex (GGCS) and blastfurnace (GGBS) slags) of varying chemical composition, and from different sources were used to make concretes using two w/b ratios (0.40 and 0.60) and three slag replacement levels (20%, 35% and 50%). The effect of chemical composition and replacement level of slags on the chloride penetration resistance of the concretes was assessed using the chloride conductivity test. The results showed that the chloride penetration resistance of concrete increases with decreasing w/b ratio and increasing slag replacement level. In the GGAS concretes, despite having relatively low SiO2 and high MgO content, its significantly high Mn2O3 and low Al2O3 content was found to have a negative effect on the chloride penetration resistance of the concrete. The significantly high chloride penetration resistance of GGCS concretes was partly attributed to both its high CaO content and particle fineness. Only GGCS concretes showed a trend of increasing chloride penetration resistance with increased particle fineness; GGBS and GGAS concretes did not show any trend between particle fineness and chloride penetration resistance.

Title:
Influence of the initial water content in flash calcined metakaolin-based geopolymer
Abstract:
This study assesses the influence of the initial amount of water in metakaolin-based geopolymer on some of its properties in the hardened state. Results suggest a linearly decreasing influence of the amount of water on the mechanical performance of the geopolymer and showed that the majority of this water was not bonded to the structure. Moreover, it was found that whatever the amount of water initially introduced, all the samples contained the same amount of water after a drying period. The study of the porous network showed a large pore volume of 50% of the total volume which corresponds to the volume of water initially introduced. Finally, the observation of numerous macropore helped to explain the high transfer coefficients measured on the geopolymer.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effects of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin on the morphology and mechanical properties of metakaolin-based geopolymer
Abstract:
Natural fiber-reinforced geopolymer has attracted wide attention in construction and building materials due to its low cost, low density, and excellent mechanical properties. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three basic components of natural fibres, and were investigated to reveal their influence on the metakaolin-based geopolymer. Comparative evaluations were investigated via morphology analysis and mechanical strength analysis. The results showed distinct microstructures and mechanical properties of the geopolymer-based materials with cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively. A low content (5 wt%) of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose enhanced the flexural and compressive strength of pure geopolymer. Higher lignin and hemicellulose led to the porous morphology, lower density, and brittle fractures of geopolymer-based composites, which reduced the flexural and compressive strength in these geopolymer-based composites. It was noted that the degree of geopolymerization was clearly lowered by the alkaline degradation of hemicellulose. With the increase in cellulose content, in contrast, the denser structure and fewer pores of the geopolymer matrix were detected, as well as ductile failures of geopolymer-based composites. Good bonding was also shown between the geopolymer matrix and cellulose fibres without remarkable degradation. The results of this study will facilitate a better understanding of the effect of lignocellulosic biomass in natural fibre-reinforced geopolymers and should serve as the basis for further research and applications.The material of interest is:

Cement/rock interaction in geothermal wells. The effect of silica addition to the cement and the impact of CO2 enriched brine
Abstract:
One of the main issues associated with ongoing exploitation of the geothermal resources in New Zealand has been concerns of the durability of the cement sheath formed during downhole cementing and the impact it has on the lifetime of wells, many of which do not last as long as desirable. Research is being conducted to improve the understanding of how the current cement formulations perform in the high temperature, high CO2 concentration and low pH fluids found within New Zealand's geothermal systems where CO2 induced corrosion has been shown ().The material of interest is:

Title:
Evaluation of Industrial by-products as pozzolans: A road map for use in concrete production
Abstract:
According to the Resource Efficiency Roadmap, the building sector is one of the key sectors addressing the challenges of energy, climate change and resource efficiency. The presence of legally binding guidelines in EU legislation regarding waste has already contributed significantly to waste management practices and innovations in the field of recycling; it has also limited the landfilling process and created incentives to change consumer habits. Thus, it is important to focus on the efficient use of resources by replacing commercially-available products with industrial by-products or waste materials. The concrete industry is the largest in the building sector, so the focus of reaching the targets mentioned above is in the daily scope for engineers and researchers. Reducing the costly and environmentally aggressive Portland cement and increasing concrete durability are the targets that act as guidelines for concrete development. Both issues have proven to be partially solved by incorporating supplementary cementitious materials, also known as pozzolans, in concrete composition. Following the American standard ASTM C125, the pozzolans contain siliceous and aluminous materials, which possess little or no cementitious value but will, in finely divided forms in the presence of moisture, react chemically with calcium hydroxide at ordinary temperatures to form compounds possessing cementitious properties. Pozzolans are usually introduced in the composition of concrete to reduce the amount of cement needed and improve its durability. Pozzolans reduce absorption, permeability and ion diffusivity by reducing the porosity of the binder due to the formation of a calcium silicate hydrate gel from the pozzolan and excess Ca(OH)2 coming from the Portland cement. The amount of pozzolans introduced varies, from 5 to 40 wt.% of the cement. The typical natural pozzolans are metakaolin , pumice and natural zeolites , while the most popular commercial material used as a pozzolan in the concrete industry is silica fume and fly ash [,]. Different waste-origin pozzolans are being intensively researched as alternatives to existing ones, and the most promising are calcined clay and glass waste, different types of ashes including coal bottom ash, which could reduce the total cement content by 20 wt.%, retaining the given strength class and also reducing concrete cost by 9%. The major concern regarding the use of waste glass as supplementary cementitious materials are alkali content. It is concluded that alkali content within glasses should be limited to a maximum of 4%. This is why in this research two types of glasses were evaluated regarding to its alkali content - low alkali glass (<4%) and high alkali content glass (>4%).The material of interest is:

Title:
Studies on concrete containing ground waste glass
Abstract:
The possibility of using finely ground waste glass as partial cement replacement in concrete was examined through three sets of tests: the lime-glass tests to assess the pozzolanic activity of ground glass, the compressive strength tests of concrete having 30% cement replaced by ground glass to monitor the strength development, and the mortar bar tests to study the potential expansion. The results showed that ground glass having a particle size finer than 38 Î¼m did exhibit a pozzolanic behavior. The compressive strength from lime-glass tests exceeded a threshold value of 4.1 MPa. The strength activity index was 91, 84, 96, and 108% at 3, 7, 28, and 90 days, respectively, exceeding 75% at all ages. The mortar bar tests demonstrated that the finely ground glass helped reduce the expansion by up to 50%. A size effect was observed; a smaller glass particle size led to a higher reactivity with lime, a higher compressive strength in concrete, and a lower expansion. Compared to fly ash concrete, concrete containing ground glass exhibited a higher strength at both early and late ages.The material of interest is:

Title:
A comparative study of impact behaviour between natural flax and glass FRP confined concrete composites
Abstract:
This research addresses the dynamic compressive properties of flax fibre reinforced polymer (FFRP) and glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) confined concrete under impact loadings. The investigations were performed by conducting impact tests using a high-speed servo-hydraulic machine, with the impact-induced strain rates ranging from 0.2s-1 to 30s-1. Plain concrete (PC), FFRP-PC, and GFRP-PC specimens were tested. The influences of FRP confinement and strain rate on compressive strength, stress and strain time histories were studied. The failure processes of the specimens were analysed via evaluating the high-speed camera photographs. The empirical relationship between the corresponding dynamic increase factor (DIF) of compressive strength and strain rate for PC, FFRP-PC and GFRP-PC were proposed based on experimental data. Experimental results of FFRP-PC and GFRP-PC specimens were compared to assess the confinement effectiveness of the FRP.The material of interest is:

Title:
Properties of lightweight fly ash geopolymer concrete containing bottom ash as aggregates
Abstract:
AbstractIn order to evaluate the utilization of waste from coal combustion thermal power plant, the properties of lightweight geopolymer concrete (LWGC) containing fly ash as geopolymer binder and bottom ash as aggregates were studied. Sodium silicate solution (NS) and 10M sodium hydroxide (NH) were used as alkali activators. The NS/NH ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 with liquid/ash (L/A) ratios of 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80 were used. The compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, surface abrasion resistance, density, thermal conductivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of concrete were tested. The results indicated that fly ash and bottom ash could be used to produce LWGCs with compressive strengths of 14.3â18.1MPa, splitting tensile strengths of 1.2â2.0MPa, and densities of 1661â1688kg/m3. Theirs thermal conductivity coefficients of 0.43â0.47W/mK were lower than those of the geopolymer concrete containing natural aggregate. LWGCs in this study could thus be used for moderate strength concrete and thermal insulation concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Pore structure and surface area of hardened cement pastes containing silica fume
Abstract:
Specific surface areas and pore structure studies were carried out on the hardened cement pastes containing various amounts of silica fume after being hydrated for different ages. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined for all pastes at the boiling point of nitrogen, from low pressures to the saturation pressure. The effect of content of silica fume on the properties of the silica fume-Portland cement pastes was discussed. The specific surface areas as well as the total pore volume were found to decrease with increasing amount of silica fume as hydration proceeded. The variations of the nitrogen surface area, the total pore volume and the mean hydraulic radius of the total pore system accessible to nitrogen molecules are discussed and the results are related as much as possible to the formed hydrates.The material of interest is:

Preparation of sulphoaluminate belite cement from fly ash
Abstract:
Sulphoaluminate belite cements containing the phases C2S, C4A3 S, C4AF, CS were synthesised from limestone, fly ash and gypsum at 1200 degC. The correspondence between the predicted phase composition and real phase composition were checked. The influence of quantities of different phases in the hydration behaviour and strength development were verified. Results show that an optimum proportion of phase quantities help in high strenght development in early age. These cements fulfill all the requirement of Portland cement and have very high early strength. Porosity measurements show that the total pore volume in early period is comparatively less than that of Ordinary Portland Cement. Thus these cements can be usable for special purposes.The material of interest is:

Title:
Stabilization of Recycled Demolition Aggregates by Geopolymers comprising Calcium Carbide Residue, Fly Ash and Slag precursors
Abstract:
Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) is the by-product of acetylene gas production. In this research, the alkali activation of Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) was studied as an economical and low-carbon precursor for development of geopolymer binder. Recycled Concrete aggregates (RCA) and Crushed Brick (CB) are the two major demolition material sources for the Construction and Demolition (C&D) industry. The cement stabilization of C&D materials has been evaluated in recent years, however due to the large carbon footprint associated with Portland cement, geopolymers which utilize the alkali activation of industrial waste by-products have garnered increasing interest from industry. Evaluation of the geopolymer stabilization of C&D materials with CCR precursor were also compared with traditional Fly Ash (FA) and Slag (S) precursors. In addition, the performance of CCR based geopolymers with supplementary FA and S precursors were also evaluated. The three precursors (CCR, FA, S) were combined with contents of up to 10% for the geopolymer stabilization of the C&D materials. A liquid alkaline activator comprising sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used for the alkali activation of the CCR based geopolymers. The strength and durability of the geopolymer stabilized C&D materials were evaluated to ascertain their application in pavement bases/subbases. The results of Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Resilient Modulus (MR) testing of these geopolymer stabilized CB and RCA aggregates indicate that different mixtures of CCR based geopolymers can be used to improve the strength properties of the C&D aggregates for pavement base/subbase applications. CCR + 5% S with the C&D materials resulted in the optimum combination for CCR based geopolymer stabilization of C&D aggregates.The material of interest is:

Title:
Influence and mechanism of micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of concrete
Abstract:
The abrasion resistances of concrete in which the cement was partially replaced by 40 wt% super fine slag (SFS), 5 wt% nano-SiO2 (NS), 5 wt% NS and 25 wt% fly ash (FA) were tested. Mechanisms responsible for the affection of these micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of the concrete were analyzed through measurements of the micro-hardness of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of the aggregate-cement matrix and the cement matrix, the hydration products of the paste, and the degree of polymerization of the silicate chains of C-S-H in the paste. Results indicated that the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA improved the abrasion resistance of the surface mortar layer by 82%, 73% and 68%, respectively, and that of the concrete by 20%, 16% and 13%, respectively. Because of the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA, Ca(OH)2 was consumed to produce more calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and other aluminiferous hydration products, and the degree of polymerization of silicate chains in C-S-H was increased. Therefore, the micro-mechanical properties of the ITZ and the cement matrix were strengthened, improving the abrasion resistance of the concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Characteristics of boroaluminosilicate geopolymers
Abstract:
In this work, a method for incorporating fly ash in constructional technology was developed by production of boroaluminosilicate geopolymers. These new class of geopolymers were appropriately synthesized from mixtures of fly ash and anhydrous borax and compressive strengths as high as 64MPa were achieved by using suitable amount of borax. Different types of microstructures were observed by changing mixture proportion of the specimens. All of specimens revealed a brittle fracture with no crack branching in the mixture. Additionally, less unreacted fly ash particle was observed in the considered pastes indicating a totally different fracture mechanism in boroaluminosilicate geopolymers than aluminosilicate ones. FT-IR analyses of the mixtures revealed an additional B-O bond in comparison with aluminosilicate geopolymers. It was shown that this bond is a key factor to determine compressive strength and specimens with no B-O bond have lower strengths.The material of interest is:

Title:
Microstructural and compositional change of NaOH-activated high calcium fly ash by incorporating Na-aluminate and co-existence of geopolymeric gel and CâSâH(I)
Abstract:
This study explores the reaction products of alkali-activated Class C fly ash-based aluminosilicate samples by means of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HSXRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and compressive strength tests to investigate how the readily available aluminum affects the reaction. Class C fly ash-based aluminosilicate raw materials were prepared by incorporating Na-aluminate into the original fly ashes, then alkali-activated by 10M NaOH solution. Incorporating Na-aluminate reduced the compressive strength of samples, with the reduction magnitude relatively constant regardless of length of curing period. The HSXRD provides evidence of the co-existence of CâSâH with geopolymeric gels and strongly suggests that the CâSâH formed in the current system is CâSâH(I). The back-scattered electron images suggest that the CâSâH(I) phase exists as small grains in a finely intermixed form with geopolymeric gels. Despite providing extra source of aluminum, adding Na-aluminate to the mixes did not decrease the Si/Al ratio of the geopolymeric gel.The material of interest is:

Title:
Nanoindentation study of calcium silicate hydrates in concrete produced with effective microorganisms-based bioplasticizer
Abstract:
The mechanical properties of concrete produced with effective microorganisms (EM)-based bioplasticizer are investigated by means of statistical nanoindentation, and compared to the nanomechanical properties of concrete produced with ordinary superplasticizer (SP). The resort to nanoindentation enables to survey the elasticity, hardness and long-term logarithmic relaxation behavior of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) after few minutes only. For each material, a cluster analysis of the experimental results yields groupings of indents likely performed on C-S-H with distinct packing densities. It is found that the addition of EM-based bioplasticizer improves the strength of C-S-H by enhancing the cohesion and friction of solid nanograins, and decreases the absolute rate of long-term relaxation. The statistical analysis of indentation results also suggests that EM-based bioplasticizer inhibits the precipitation of C-S-H of higher density. The findings of this work corroborate the results of a previous study which attributed an increase of homogeneity and a refinement of the crystalline structure of silicate phases to the effect of a biomodifier similar to EM-based bioplasticizer. The improvement of strength properties of C-S-H is also shown to coincide with a gain of compressive strength measured at the macroscale of EM-based concrete.The material of interest is:

Macro/micro-pore structure characteristics and the chloride penetration of self-compacting concrete incorporating different types of filler and mineral admixture
Abstract:
The relationship between the internal pore structure features at different scales and the local micro-characteristics of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) to the non-steady state chloride migration coefficient (Dnssm) is investigated for one normal and three types of sustainable high performance self-compacting concrete mixes. The pore structure classification at different scales and the percolation degrees of the ITZ's pores were determined using both vacuum-saturated and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) techniques. Further, the local micro-permeation features of the ITZ, such as thickness, porosity and the chemistry of its hydration products is examined using the SEM coupled with the EDX analysis on polished, carbon-coated, flat specimens.

Title:
Transport properties of high-volume fly ash concrete: Capillary water sorption, water sorption under vacuum and gas permeability
Abstract:
Studying concreteâs resistance to carbonation-induced corrosion usually involves exposing the material to CO2 for quite some time. To estimate the performance of high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete more quickly, two key properties governing this process can be studied, namely water penetrability and gas permeability. With respect to HVFA mixtures optimized for usage in an environment exposed to carbonation with wetting and drying, we adopted the latter approach. This paper presents a full assessment of concrete mixtures with varying fly ash amounts. A 50% fly ash mixture by mass with a binder content of 400Â kg/m3 and a water-to-binder ratio of 0.4 had a lower capillary water uptake (â32.6%), water sorption under vacuum (â10.7%) and gas permeability (â78.9%) than a proper reference normally used in this environment. The fly ash applied had an excellent quality regarding loss on ignition (3.5%) and fineness (19% retained on a 45Â Î¼m sieve).The material of interest is:

Influence and mechanism of micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of concrete
Abstract:
The abrasion resistances of concrete in which the cement was partially replaced by 40 wt% super fine slag (SFS), 5 wt% nano-SiO2 (NS), 5 wt% NS and 25 wt% fly ash (FA) were tested. Mechanisms responsible for the affection of these micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of the concrete were analyzed through measurements of the micro-hardness of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of the aggregate-cement matrix and the cement matrix, the hydration products of the paste, and the degree of polymerization of the silicate chains of C-S-H in the paste. Results indicated that the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA improved the abrasion resistance of the surface mortar layer by 82%, 73% and 68%, respectively, and that of the concrete by 20%, 16% and 13%, respectively. Because of the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA, Ca(OH)2 was consumed to produce more calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and other aluminiferous hydration products, and the degree of polymerization of silicate chains in C-S-H was increased. Therefore, the micro-mechanical properties of the ITZ and the cement matrix were strengthened, improving the abrasion resistance of the concrete.The material of interest is:

Effects of Shirasu natural pozzolan and limestone powder on the strength and aggressive chemical resistance of concrete
Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of using limestone powder and Shirasu natural pozzolan, as partial replacements for fine aggregate, on the mechanical properties and resistance of concrete to an aggressive solution containing 3% H2SO4 and 5% MgCl2. The data show that replacing 5% of the fine aggregate with limestone powder results in more severe deterioration of the concrete by the chemical solution. However, replacing 55% of the fine aggregate with Shirasu both increases compressive strength after a 28-day cure and improves chemical resistance of concrete. In addition, the deterioration mechanism of concrete immersed in the aggressive solution was examined in this study.The material of interest is:

Effects of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin on the morphology and mechanical properties of metakaolin-based geopolymer
Abstract:
Natural fiber-reinforced geopolymer has attracted wide attention in construction and building materials due to its low cost, low density, and excellent mechanical properties. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three basic components of natural fibres, and were investigated to reveal their influence on the metakaolin-based geopolymer. Comparative evaluations were investigated via morphology analysis and mechanical strength analysis. The results showed distinct microstructures and mechanical properties of the geopolymer-based materials with cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively. A low content (5 wt%) of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose enhanced the flexural and compressive strength of pure geopolymer. Higher lignin and hemicellulose led to the porous morphology, lower density, and brittle fractures of geopolymer-based composites, which reduced the flexural and compressive strength in these geopolymer-based composites. It was noted that the degree of geopolymerization was clearly lowered by the alkaline degradation of hemicellulose. With the increase in cellulose content, in contrast, the denser structure and fewer pores of the geopolymer matrix were detected, as well as ductile failures of geopolymer-based composites. Good bonding was also shown between the geopolymer matrix and cellulose fibres without remarkable degradation.

Title:
Influence of seawater and blast furnace cement employment on recycled aggregate concretesâ properties
Abstract:
AbstractRecycled aggregates of mixed composition (MRA) may exhibit great variability in their properties, which in turn reduces their applicability. This study intends to extend the use of MRA in a broadened scope of applications by producing recycled aggregate concretes (RAC), which were mixed using two different types of cement, ordinary Portland cement and cement incorporating blast-furnace slag, and two types of water, fresh and seawater. The testing programme included analyses of the properties of concrete in its fresh (setting time and plastic shrinkage) and hardened state (physical, mechanical and drying shrinkage). The results showed that all of the physical and several of the mechanical properties as well as drying shrinkage were negatively influenced by the use of MRA. In contrast, however, the plastic shrinkage and flexural strength were improved. The use of seawater improved the mechanical properties, reduced setting time and increased drying shrinkage, however, it was found that the cement type was more influential on most of the properties. The use of seawater and cement with blast-furnace slag improved the performances of the RAC.The material of interest is:

Title:
Calcined clay limestone cements (LC3)
Abstract:
The use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to replace part of the clinker in cement is the most successful strategy to reduce CO2 emissions in the global cement industry. However, limited supplies of conventional SCMs make it difficult to take this strategy further unless new types of SCMs become available. The only type of material available in the quantities needed to meet demand is clay containing kaolinite, which can be calcined to produce an effective SCM. Such clays are widely available in countries where most growth in demand for cement is forecast.The material of interest is:

Title:
Potassium geopolymer foams made with silica fume pore forming agent for thermal insulation
Abstract:
Porous potassium based geopolymers with a mutli-scale porosity were synthesized. Silica fume is introduced as an additive to the geopolymer formulation. The free silicon contained inside this silica fume is oxidized in alkaline solution, releasing molecular hydrogen which generates the porosity. Previous work has shown how the porosity can be controlled with temperature, repeated temperature cycles and the mass introduced. Using this protocol, homogeneous foams were made and then studied with scanning electron microscopy. In particular the foam expansion has been followed with time in relation to the microstructure. The thermal conductivity values of the foams were evaluated using a fluxmeter method. The effective thermal conductivities are comprised between 0.12 and 0.35 W m-1 K-1 for apparent densities ranging from 0.40 to 0.85 g cm-3. The corresponding calculated pore volume fractions are in the range of 65-85%. The interest of this material is that it combines the advantages of low bulk density and insulating properties with the characteristics of a geopolymer skeleton. Literature reports a very good fire and acid/base resistance, a low cost of production and the possibility of recycling industrial waste in the form of silica fume.The material of interest is:

Title:
Recycling of crushed stone powder as a partial replacement for silica powder in extruded cement panels
Abstract:
The continuously increasing amount of crushed stone powder normally coming from the production of crushed aggregates or sawing stone has led to an increase in the waste disposal costs or instances of improper disposal. In this study, the effective methodology to increase the utilization of crushed stone powder was studied by considering CaO/SiO2 mole ratio in mix design. The hydrothermal reaction to synthesis tobermorite related to strength development was also considered to improve rigidity in hardened cement. The results showed the optimized C/S mole ratio is 0.87 and a valid method for curing conditions relating to hardened cement was desired to be acquired by 2h of pre-curing, 4h of atmosphere steam curing (65degC) and 4h of autoclave curing (180degC, 10atm). The extruded panels satisfied all performance requirements relating to fire resistance as well as sound insulation and can have a possible application to building materials. The main findings of this investigation revealed that the stable crystal formation of tobermorite by the hydrothermal synthesis reaction affects the most important mechanism in hardened cement and mix design by considering C/S mole rate in addition to the analysis of microstructures promotes the recycling of crushed stone powder for building materials.The material of interest is:

Title:
Experimental characterization of binary and ternary blended-cement concretes containing ultrafine residual rice husk and sugar cane bagasse ashes
Abstract:
AbstractIn the present work an experimental program was carried out to investigate the influence of residual sugar cane bagasse and rice husk ashes (SCBA and RHA, respectively) in the properties of concretes. SCBA and RHA were produced using vibratory grinding in dry open circuit and conventional and high-performance concretes were produced with 0% and 20% of both ashes as cement replacement (by mass). Ternary mixtures containing cement, SCBA and RHA (0.6â0.2â0.2) were also produced in order to study the benefits of the simultaneous use of both ultrafine ashes on concrete properties. Experiments were performed to investigate the rheology (yield stress and plastic viscosity), compressive strength (at 7, 28, 90, and 180days), Youngâs modulus (at 28days) and rapid chloride-ion penetrability. The pore size distribution and adiabatic temperature rise of the reference and ternary mixtures were also evaluated. The joint influence of both ashes allowed reaching positive effects in rheology and kept constant or increased the compressive strength when compared to the reference mixtures. Moreover, the ternary concretes presented lower electric charges and the replacement of cement by 40% SCBA and RHA decreased significantly the maximum adiabatic temperature rise of conventional concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
The effect of natural zeolites on the early hydration of Portland cement
Abstract:
In this work, the effect of zeolite, coming from Pentalofos area, Thrace, Greece, on the hydration of cement is examined. The experimental part comprises three stages: In the first stage a complete mineralogical characterization of the zeolite was performed. In addition, the pozzolanic reactivity of the zeolite was evaluated on the basis of Chapelle test. In the second stage, pastes of Portland cement, incorporating 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% per weight of fine zeolite were prepared. The pastes were water-cured at 20 degC, for 1, 2, 7 and 28 days. Finally, the hydration rate and products were studied by means of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in combination with thermoanalytical methods (TG/DTG and differential thermal analysis). As it is concluded, the examined zeolite consists mainly of ""heulandite type II"" and shows a good pozzolanic reactivity (0.555 g of Ca(OH)2 per gram of zeolite, according to the Chapelle test). The incorporation of zeolite in cement contributes to the consumption of Ca(OH)2 formed during the cement hydration and the formation of cement-like hydrated products.The material of interest is:

Title:
Heat of hydration of Portland high-calcium fly ash cement incorporating limestone powder: Effect of limestone particle size
Abstract:
This study investigated the limestone powder (LS) particle size effect on the heat of hydration of Portland cement (PC) and high-calcium fly ash (FA) systems. The LS used has a maximum particle size of 5 and 20Â Î¼m, respectively. Isothermal calorimetry was used to measure the heat evolution during the hydration process of the cement and PCâFA pastes. The results show the particle size of LS had a significant influence on the observed heat of hydration both on rate of reaction and total amount of heat release. The hydration rates of both PCâLS and PCâFAâLS systems were accelerated by 5Â Î¼m LS, while 20Â Î¼m LS did not. For PCâFAâLS system, the total heat release at 48Â h when using 5Â Î¼m LS were higher than FA at 30% replacement level whereas 20Â Î¼m LS showed similar total heat release. However, the total heat release of these ternary mixtures with both LS particle sizes was still lower than PC control. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis were applied to identify the hydration products. XRD results show the formation of carboaluminates and ettringite was still found at 28Â days, indicated the stabilization of ettringite when both LS particle size were used. The reaction between LS and PC or FA was confirmed by TG results in the reduction of CaCO3 content.The material of interest is:

Title:
The influence of silica fume on the corrosion resistance of steel in high performance concrete exposed to simulated sea water
Abstract:
This investigation examined the influence of silica fume on the corrosion behaviour of steel in high performance concrete (HPC) by comparing the behaviour of HPC concretes with and without a 10% by mass of cement addition of silica fume. Reinforced concrete prisms (500 x 100 x 100 mm) with embedded corrosion probes were loaded in three-point bending to achieve a 0.3 mm crack and exposed to simulated sea water for up to four years. Corresponding prisms without induced cracks were also studied as controls. For the HPC with silica fume, pore size distribution measurements showed that after exposure to the simulated sea water, the hydration and pozzolanic reactions near the induced crack blocked almost all continuous pores in the 0.01 to 10 Î¼m range. This affected the type and distribution of corrosion products that formed by restricting the access of chlorides and oxygen to the surface of the steel. Thus, only magnetite (Fe3O4) formed and was confined the space provided by the induced crack, effectively plugging the crack. In HPC without silica fume, oxygenated corrosion products such as goethite (Î±-FeOOH) and akaganeite (Î²-FeOOH) formed in the induced crack region. The implications of these observations on the service life of high performance concrete structures are discussed.The material of interest is:

Title:
Exploitation of poor Greek kaolins: strength development of metakaolin concrete and evaluation by means of k-value
Abstract:
In this paper, the effect of metakaolin on concrete properties is investigated. A poor Greek kaolin was thermally treated at defined conditions, and the produced metakaolin was superfine ground. In addition, a commercial metakaolin of high purity was used. Eight mixture proportions were used to produce high-performance concrete, where metakaolin replaced either cement or sand in percentages of 10% or 20% by weight of the control cement content. The strength development of metakaolin concrete was evaluated using the efficiency factor (k-value). The produced metakaolin as well as the commercial one imparts a similar behavior with respect to the concrete strength. Both metakaolins exhibit very high k-values (close to 3.0 at 28 days) and are characterised as highly reactive pozzolanic materials that can lead to concrete production with an excellent performance.The material of interest is:

Title:
Evaluation of spray-dried sludge from drinking water treatment plants as a prime material for clinker manufacture
Abstract:
This study evaluates the suitability of a water treatment plant spray-dried (atomized) sludge as a prime material for clinker manufacture. A study of the thermal behaviour of the atomized sludge was followed by a comparison of the burnability of two raw mixes, one (control) made with industrial prime materials (limestone, clay, sand) and the other with the same components except that the clay was replaced by sludge. The materials were ground to the same fineness in both mixes. The composition of the two raw mixes was: silica modulus (Ms=SiO2/(Al2O3+Fe2O3)=2.30), the lime saturation factor (LSF=CaO/(2.8SiO2+1.18Al2O3+0.65Fe2O3)=0.98) and flux modulus (Mf=Al2O3/Fe2O3=1.50). The free lime in the two raw mixes was measured after clinkerization at 1400, 1450 and 1500degC for 30min. The clinkers obtained at 1450degC were characterized with XRF, XRD, FTIR, OM and SEM/EDX.The material of interest is:

Title:
Synergistic utilization of red mud for flue-gas desulfurization and fly ash-based geopolymer preparation
Abstract:
As an industrial waste characterized by huge volume and high alkalinity, red mud has become a serious environmental problem. The reuse of red mud has been explored in previous studies, including as building materials and for soil and waste water treatment. In this study, an innovation was made for the reuse of red mud to create a synergistic effect. Red mud was first used in flue gas desulfurization (FGD), and then the desulfurized red mud was again reused to make a geopolymer material. By using one type of original red mud and three types of fly ash, this study revealed that with high alkalinity and desulfurization capacity, the red mud could serve as an excellent FGD sorbent. After FGD, the sodium sulfate in the desulfurized red mud acted as a chemical activator for geopolymer made with class C fly ash. A 25% increase in strength was observed between the geopolymers with the red mud after FGD and with the original one. There are no significant benefits of FGD on the class F fly ash-based geopolymers and further study is required.The material of interest is:

Title:
Accelerating effects of colloidal nano-silica for beneficial calciumâsilicateâhydrate formation in cement
Abstract:
The hydration process of Ca3SiO5 (C3S) cement is investigated, and accelerating effects of adding colloidal silica (CS) are established. CS accelerates dissolution of the C3S phase, and renders a more rapid formation of the calciumâsilicateâhydrate (CâSâH) binding phase. The role of water is demonstrated. Water evaporation correlates with the appearance of a sharp IR band at 3650 cmâ1 signifying non-hydrogen bonded OH groups. Incomplete hydration results in Ca(OH)2 precipitation. Suppression of water evaporation causes the 3650 cmâ1 band to vanish. The Ca2+ ions become incorporated in the CâSâH network, the formation of which is accelerated by CS.The material of interest is:

Chemical activation of blended cements made with lime and natural pozzolans
Abstract:
This paper deals with the chemical activation of lime-pozzolan cement (LPC), which consists of 80% natural pozzolan and 20% hydrated lime (by mass). Results show that the addition of 4% Na2SO4 can significantly improve the early strength of this cement. The presence of 4% flake calcium chloride (CaCl2.2H2O) is not helpful to early strength, but can increase the later strength substantially. CaSO4.O.5H2O and NaCl do not demonstrate an obvious effect on the strength development of the cement. Combination of activators, such as CaCl2.2H2O+Na2SO4 or Na2SO4+NaCl does not improve the activation effect; pastes with 2% Na2SO4+2% NaCl show lower strength than the pastes with 2% Na2SO4 alone.The material of interest is:

Title:
Study on the development of inorganic polymers from red mud and slag system: Application in mortar and lightweight materials
Abstract:
The conversion of red mud into valuable products remains an important issue to be addressed. Inorganic polymers from red mud and slag system were investigated. Slag was substituted at 25, 50 and 75% by red mud in the system. Sodium silicate solutions of modulus ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 were used and the samples were cured at 25, 40 and 60 degC. Slag was amorphous phase while red mud contained some crystalline phases, mainly hematite, crancrinite and katoite. A better reactivity, faster setting and lower shrinkage were obtained for higher contents of slag, with a modulus of sodium silicate solution of 2.0. The composition made of 50% red mud and 50% slag achieved a 7 days compressive strength of 54 MPa at 25 degC. The use of standard sand and hydrogen peroxide allowed the formation of mortar and lightweight materials with reduced mechanical properties, but still of interest to address both issues of sustainable use of resources and CO2 reduction in construction.The material of interest is:

Abrasion resistance of alkali-activated slag concrete designed by Taguchi method
Abstract:
a b s t r a c t In this study, abrasion resistance of Alkali-Activated Slag (AAS) concrete was investigated according to ASTM C1138. Four affecting factors including curing temperature, alkaline solution to slag weight ratio, concentration of sodium hydroxide solution and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio were considered to achieve the maximum compressive strength and abrasion resistance of AAS concrete using the Taguchi design of experiment method. Based on the results, the mixture with alkaline solution to slag weight ratio of 0.45, sodium hydroxide concentration of 6 M and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio of 3, that had been cured at 95 C, and the mixture with alkaline solution to slag weight ratio of 0.4, sodium hydroxide concentration of 6 M and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio of 3, that had been cured at 25 C, were obtained as the optimal mixtures for maximum compressive strength and abrasion resistance, respectively. The results also showed that abrasion resistance of AAS concrete was significantly increased by improving the quality of surface and changing the curing regime. Water curing as an appropriate method improved the surface conditions and considerably increased the abrasion  resistance of AAS concrete too. In addition, the results showed that the CO2 footprint of AAS concrete was approximately 51% less than that of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete and therefore the eco-mechanical  performance of AAS concrete was superior.

Properties of lightweight fly ash geopolymer concrete containing bottom ash as aggregates
Abstract:
AbstractIn order to evaluate the utilization of waste from coal combustion thermal power plant, the properties of lightweight geopolymer concrete (LWGC) containing fly ash as geopolymer binder and bottom ash as aggregates were studied. Sodium silicate solution (NS) and 10M sodium hydroxide (NH) were used as alkali activators. The NS/NH ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 with liquid/ash (L/A) ratios of 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80 were used. The compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, surface abrasion resistance, density, thermal conductivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of concrete were tested. The results indicated that fly ash and bottom ash could be used to produce LWGCs with compressive strengths of 14.3â18.1MPa, splitting tensile strengths of 1.2â2.0MPa, and densities of 1661â1688kg/m3. Theirs thermal conductivity coefficients of 0.43â0.47W/mK were lower than those of the geopolymer concrete containing natural aggregate. LWGCs in this study could thus be used for moderate strength concrete and thermal insulation concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Use of pretreatment to prevent expansion and foaming in high-performance MSWI bottom ash alkali-activated mortars
Abstract:
This study has investigated the impact of foaming and expansion of municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash (BA) during alkali reaction. Furthermore, the activity enhancement of the BA has been investigated. Based on the microanalytic appearance and compressive strength of the samples, the results show that the reaction between the metallic aluminium in the BA and alkali in the activator, which produced large quantities of hydrogen, is the primary cause for both foaming and expansion. The residual organic matter and unburnt substances in the BA are the main factors that affect the activity. However, the alkali defoaming and calcination-melting pretreatments completely prevented the expansion and calcining further improved the BA activity. The alkali activated materials prepared with the BA calcined at 700degC, granulated blast furnace slag, and slaked lime followed by alkali defoaming pretreatment produced the best mechanical properties.The material of interest is:

Title:
Physical and mechanical properties of unheated and heated kaolin based-geopolymers with partial replacement of aluminium hydroxide
Abstract:
Amorphous aluminium hydroxide and aluminium oxy-hydroxide were used as replacements in the synthesis of kaolin based-geopolymers. Physical and mechanical properties of geopolymers cured at 60 degC and exposed at elevated temperatures (300-1200 degC) were investigated. It was found that when cured at 60 degC, specimens with replacements exhibited low compressive strength as compared to those without replacement. Conversely, when heated as from 1100 degC, both compressive strength and volume stability of specimens with replacement were improved. Thus, specimens without replacement were morphologically damaged at 1150 degC whereas those with 10% by mass of amorphous aluminium hydroxide or with 30% by mass of aluminium oxy-hydroxide showed good volume stability at 1150 and 1200 degC respectively. Additionally, geopolymers with 30% by mass of aluminium oxy-hydroxide that were heated at 1100 degC showed compressive strength of 29.1 MPa whereas those with 10% by mass of amorphous aluminium hydroxide gave 60.2 MPa at 1150 degC. This was attributed to the improvement of compactness of specimens along with the formation of stable crystalline phases. Yet, heating geopolymers at 1200 degC led to partial dissolution of nepheline and carnegieite which generates closed pores hence decrease of compressive strength. Partial replacement of amorphous aluminium hydroxide or aluminium oxy-hydroxide in the synthesis of kaolin-based geopolymers allows both improvement of compressive strength and thermal stability of heated kaolin-based geopolymers.The material of interest is:

Title:
Experimental investigation of the effect of silica fume on the thermal spalling of reactive powder concrete
Abstract:
The distinct spalling performances of reactive powder concrete (RPC) specimens with various silica fume (SF) contents exposed to high temperatures were observed via high-resolution photography. The RPC microstructures and pore structures after high-temperature exposure were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results provide experimental evidence of the high-temperature spalling mechanism of RPC. Increasing the SF content in RPC increases its compressive strength and compactness, offering greater mitigation of devastating spalling behaviour, but also producing more pulverized spalling remnants. This is attributed to the post-heating cracked microstructure and refined pores, which promote localized rather than entirely explosive spalling.The material of interest is:

Title:
Stabilization of Recycled Demolition Aggregates by Geopolymers comprising Calcium Carbide Residue, Fly Ash and Slag precursors
Abstract:
Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) is the by-product of acetylene gas production. In this research, the alkali activation of Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) was studied as an economical and low-carbon precursor for development of geopolymer binder. Recycled Concrete aggregates (RCA) and Crushed Brick (CB) are the two major demolition material sources for the Construction and Demolition (C&D) industry. The cement stabilization of C&D materials has been evaluated in recent years, however due to the large carbon footprint associated with Portland cement, geopolymers which utilize the alkali activation of industrial waste by-products have garnered increasing interest from industry. Evaluation of the geopolymer stabilization of C&D materials with CCR precursor were also compared with traditional Fly Ash (FA) and Slag (S) precursors. In addition, the performance of CCR based geopolymers with supplementary FA and S precursors were also evaluated. The three precursors (CCR, FA, S) were combined with contents of up to 10% for the geopolymer stabilization of the C&D materials. A liquid alkaline activator comprising sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used for the alkali activation of the CCR based geopolymers. The strength and durability of the geopolymer stabilized C&D materials were evaluated to ascertain their application in pavement bases/subbases. The results of Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Resilient Modulus (MR) testing of these geopolymer stabilized CB and RCA aggregates indicate that different mixtures of CCR based geopolymers can be used to improve the strength properties of the C&D aggregates for pavement base/subbase applications. CCR + 5% S with the C&D materials resulted in the optimum combination for CCR based geopolymer stabilization of C&D aggregates.The material of interest is:

Title:
Corrosion protection performance of microsilica added concretes in NaCl and seawater environments
Abstract:
In a hardened concrete structure, diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide, aggressive ions and moisture from the concrete/environment to the concrete/rebar interfaces takes place through the pores. This results in the failure of the passivation provided by the alkalinity of the cement to the rebars. Microsilica is a mineral that improves the corrosion protection and strength of concrete by reducing the permeability of the concrete and forming more calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) which provides strength and durability to concrete. In order to study the corrosion protection behavior of microsilica in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and sulfate resistant cement (SRC), carbon steel reinforced concrete specimens of above cements containing 10% each of densified (DMS) and undensified (UDMS) microsilica were exposed to 5% NaCl solution and seawater. Corrosion of rebars was monitored using open circuit potential (OCP) measurements. Diffusion of ions into the concrete was studied by salt ingress, salt fog and rapid chloride permeability tests. It has been noted that densified microsilica provides better corrosion protection to the rebars than the undensified one. In addition to this its protective effect with SRC is much more than with OPC. An attempt has been made to explain the mechanism of corrosion protection behavior of microsilica added concrete immersed in seawater and NaCl solution.The material of interest is:

Title:
Geopolymerisation of silt generated from construction and demolition waste washing plants
Abstract:
Recycling plants that size, sort and wash construction and demolition waste can produce high quality aggregate. However, they also produce up to 80 ton per hour of filter cake waste containing fine (<63 mm) silt particles that is classified as inert waste and normally landfilled. This research investigated the potential to form geopolymers containing silt, which would allow this problematic waste to be beneficially reused as aggregate. This would significantly improve the economic viability of recycling plants that wash wastes. Silt filter cakes have been collected from a number of aggregate washing plants operating in the UK. These were found to contain similar aluminosilicate crystalline phases. Geopolymer samples were produced using silt and silt mixed with either metakaolin or pulverised fuel ash (PFA). Silt geopolymers cured at room temperature had average 7-day compressive strengths of 18.7 MPa, while partial substitution of silt by metakaolin or PFA increased average compressive strengths to 30.5 and 21.9 MPa, respectively. Curing specimens for 24 h at 105 degC resulted in a compressive strength of 39.7 MPa and microstructural analysis confirmed the formation of dense materials. These strengths are in excess of those required for materials to be used as aggregate, particularly in unbound applications. The implications of this research for the management of waste silt at construction and demolition waste washing plants are discussed.The material of interest is:

Title:
Efficient reuse of the recycled construction waste cementitious materials
Abstract:
This paper addresses the efficiently reuse of the recycled construction waste cementitious materials (RCWCM). The RCWCM is firstly collected, and then subjected to crushing, grinding and thermal treatments, respectively. After that, the obtained powder material is named dehydrated cement paste (DCP) in this study. Due to the fact that the DCP has relatively high pH value and high activity, two specific attempts are tried to efficiently reuse the obtained DCP. The results show that it is possible to produce a prefabricated building material with an industry by-product (fly ash) and a recycled waste material (DCP). The compressive strength of the produced prefabricated building material can be higher than 60MPa. Additionally, after being further dispersed, the DCP could be utilized as a high performance cement additive, which can significantly promote the hydration and microstructure development of cement.The material of interest is:

Title:
Use of glass and nylon fibers in concrete for controlling early age micro cracking in bridge decks
Abstract:
One of the major defects in concrete bridge decks are the formation of early age micro cracking which ultimately reduces its durability. The inclusion of fibers in concrete slabs has showed satisfactory performance with improved mechanical properties and reduced early age micro cracking (EAMC). The relative high compressive strength (CS), achieved by using high cement content, is the main cause of early age micro cracking in concrete. The low tensile strength (TS) also results in less resistance to early age cracking. Other factors causing EAMC include temperature rise, water content and shrinkage strain. The EAMC can be reduced by increasing CS and TS with use of economical materials other than cement. In this work, mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) and nylon fiber reinforced concrete (NFRC) are determined for the application of concrete bridge decks. The effectiveness of glass fibers (GF) and nylon fibers (NF) in concrete will be checked by comparing mechanical properties of GFRC and NFRC with that of plain concrete (PC). The mix design ratio of PC is 1:3.33:1.67 (cement:sand:aggregate) with a water cement ratio of 0.71. The GF and NF having a length of 50mm and a fiber content of 5%, by mass of cement, are added in the concrete mixture for the production of GFRC and NFRC. Standard specimens are tested for determining compressive, splitting-tensile and flexural strengths of PC, GFRC and NFRC. Pre-crack energy absorption and toughness indices are also studied for different types of loadings i.e. compressive, splitting-tensile and flexural loadings. There is a decrease in compressive strength and an increase in splitting-tensile and flexural strengths of GFRC and NFRC compared to that of PC. Even though pre-crack energy absorption of GFRC and NFRC is less but their toughness indices are more than that of PC. Thus, GFRC and NFRC are suitable for reducing EAMC in bridge decks.The material of interest is:

Title:
Study on the development of inorganic polymers from red mud and slag system: Application in mortar and lightweight materials
Abstract:
The conversion of red mud into valuable products remains an important issue to be addressed. Inorganic polymers from red mud and slag system were investigated. Slag was substituted at 25, 50 and 75% by red mud in the system. Sodium silicate solutions of modulus ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 were used and the samples were cured at 25, 40 and 60 degC. Slag was amorphous phase while red mud contained some crystalline phases, mainly hematite, crancrinite and katoite. A better reactivity, faster setting and lower shrinkage were obtained for higher contents of slag, with a modulus of sodium silicate solution of 2.0. The composition made of 50% red mud and 50% slag achieved a 7 days compressive strength of 54 MPa at 25 degC. The use of standard sand and hydrogen peroxide allowed the formation of mortar and lightweight materials with reduced mechanical properties, but still of interest to address both issues of sustainable use of resources and CO2 reduction in construction.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effect of silica fume on durability of self-compacting concrete made with waste recycled concrete aggregates
Abstract:
Due to adhered mortar in recycled concrete aggregates, some of the properties of concrete made with these types of aggregates, such as water absorption, porosity, electrical resistivity, and chloride ion penetration, may be affected. In this study, silica fume was used as a part of cementitious materials to improve the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC), which were made with fine and coarse recycled aggregates. Three series of mixtures were made in the laboratory. In the first and second series, coarse recycled aggregates with replacement of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% were used with and without silica fume. In the third series, 25% of fine recycled aggregates were replaced with fine natural aggregates. Slump flow and J-ring tests were considered for fresh state of SCC. The compressive strength, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity, electrical resistivity, and chloride ion penetration tests were performed for hardened concrete. The use of silica fume improved the properties of fresh SCC. The results showed that silica fume can reduce water absorption and porosity. The silica fume showed that can resulted in a significant increase in electrical resistivity. On the other h, the replacement of 25% of recycled aggregates did not have a significant effect on electrical resistivity, the electrical resistivity decreased by increasing the amount of replacement. Silica fume was very effective in controlling chloride ion penetration and reducing total charge passed. Silica fume also controlled the temperature of the solutions used during the test which indicates the control of the movement of ions in the penetration into concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Evaluation of blends of high and low calcium fly ashes for use as supplementary cementing materials
Abstract:
The present paper outlines the results of a research attempt aimed at developing and evaluating the performance of ternary blended cements, incorporating mixtures of two different types of fly ash (of high and low calcium content). The main target of this study was to investigate whether and by what means, the introduction of a certain type of fly ash into a fly ashâcement (FC) matrix containing a different type of ash, can improve the performance of the initial binary system. For achieving this, new pozzolans were prepared by mixing, in selected proportions, a high lime fly ash with an ash of lower calcium content. The efficiency of the new materials was examined in terms of active silica content, pozzolanic activity potential, strength development, k-values and progress of the pozzolanic action by means of fixed lime capabilities. The results obtained demonstrated that the mixtures containing equal amounts of each fly ash were the most effective for moderate cement substitution, whilst for higher replacements the intermixture possessing the highest active silica content shows supremacy at almost all hydration ages. The superior performance of the ternary fly ash blends was mainly attributed to synergistic effects detected for all the ashes utilized. These were quantified in each case and almost linear correlations were obtained with the k-values of the most efficient ternary mixes.The material of interest is:

Title:
Recycling of raw rice husk to manufacture magnesium oxysulfate cement based lightweight building materials
Abstract:
To reduce environmental pollution induced by the production of Portland cement-based building materials and eliminate the release of solid wastes from agriculture industry, this paper presents a newly-developed lightweight building material based on incorporating raw rice husk and foam bubbles in magnesium oxysulfate cement paste. Mechanical strength, bulk density, thermal conductivity and drying shrinkage of this material were carried out and phase composition, air bubble distribution and microstructure were studied on typical samples by using XRD (X-ray diffraction), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), OM (opto-digitial microscope) and SEM (scanning electron microscope) facilities. The results show that raw rice husk or/and foam bubble decrease compressive strength, thermal conductivity and bulk density. Compressive strength of this composite material at 28 days decreases from 70.4 MPa to 1.1 MPa when the bulk density ranges from 1722 kg/m3 to 450 kg/m3, being superior to traditional lightweight aggregate concretes. Drying shrinkage decreases with the incorporation of foam bubble and increases with the addition of raw rice husk. When the addition of raw rice husk is kept the same, there is an optimal dosage of foam bubble to obtain the lowest drying shrinkage. An excellent interfacial zone forms between raw rice husk and MOS cement paste due to numerous neat conical protrusions on the surface of rice husk particle. Therefore, this raw rice husk incorporated lightweight material has a great potential for applications to inner partition walls and thermal insulating components in buildings.The material of interest is:

Title:
Kinetics of fly ash geopolymerization
Abstract:
Based on the wet chemical analysis, we measured and modeled the kinetics of reactions between fly ash and KOH at various temperatures and water-to-solid mass ratios (W/S). We find that three consecutive rate-limiting processes control reaction progress: (1) dissolution or alteration of the glass phase in the fly ash, (2) classical Fick diffusion through a surface layer, and (3) diffusive transport through a more complex gel structure (interstitial gel). This sequence of processes is independent of W/S (0.35-40), temperature (22-75 degC), and KOH concentration (5-10 M). The relative contribution of each process to the overall reaction progress changes with experimental conditions. Only if and when the third process is rate limiting, a fly ash geopolymer forms and develops mechanical strength (sufficiently low W/S ratio provided). The rate of reaction progress decreases significantly, due to slow transport of reacting species to the surface of the glass particles.The material of interest is:

Calcined clay limestone cements (LC3)
Abstract:
The use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to replace part of the clinker in cement is the most successful strategy to reduce CO2 emissions in the global cement industry. However, limited supplies of conventional SCMs make it difficult to take this strategy further unless new types of SCMs become available. The only type of material available in the quantities needed to meet demand is clay containing kaolinite, which can be calcined to produce an effective SCM. Such clays are widely available in countries where most growth in demand for cement is forecast.The material of interest is:

Characterization of palm oil clinker powder for utilization in cement-based applications
Abstract:
Palm oil clinker (POC) is a waste material produced as result of using palm oil shell and mesocarp fibers as fuel to run stream turbines in palm oil mills. The current practice is to dump this waste in open land or landfill sites, which leads to environmental problems. The characterization of such waste to identify its suitability as a cement replacement materials, can ultimately lead to lower carbon footprint concrete. This paper presents the results of a study on the physical properties (particle size, specific surface, specific gravity, loss of ignition, morphology), chemical composition, organic carbon, thermal stability and mineralogical composition of palm oil clinker powder (POCP). The characterization was carried out using particle size analyzer, scanning electron microcopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), field emission scanning electron microcopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (FESEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques. From the laboratory works conducted results are defined and compared to existing literatures in tabulated form.

Improved strength development and frost resistance of Portland cement ground-granulated blast furnace slag binary binder cured at 0Â Â°C with the addition of calcium silicate hydrate seeds

Cold weather is among the main challenges facing the construction industry in cold regions. Low ambient temperatures retard the early reaction process and strength gain of cementitious materials, thereby increasing the need for heating systems, delaying framework removal, and extending construction schedules. The American Concrete Institute (ACI) defines weather as ""cold weather"" when the air temperature is below 4degC for more than three consecutive days and is not higher than 10degC for 12h. These weather conditions last for at least six months in cold regions, drastically shortening the construction and infrastructure renovation season.

Title:
Evaluation of Industrial by-products as pozzolans: A road map for use in concrete production
Abstract:
According to the Resource Efficiency Roadmap, the building sector is one of the key sectors addressing the challenges of energy, climate change and resource efficiency. The presence of legally binding guidelines in EU legislation regarding waste has already contributed significantly to waste management practices and innovations in the field of recycling; it has also limited the landfilling process and created incentives to change consumer habits. Thus, it is important to focus on the efficient use of resources by replacing commercially-available products with industrial by-products or waste materials. The concrete industry is the largest in the building sector, so the focus of reaching the targets mentioned above is in the daily scope for engineers and researchers. Reducing the costly and environmentally aggressive Portland cement and increasing concrete durability are the targets that act as guidelines for concrete development. Both issues have proven to be partially solved by incorporating supplementary cementitious materials, also known as pozzolans, in concrete composition. Following the American standard ASTM C125, the pozzolans contain siliceous and aluminous materials, which possess little or no cementitious value but will, in finely divided forms in the presence of moisture, react chemically with calcium hydroxide at ordinary temperatures to form compounds possessing cementitious properties. Pozzolans are usually introduced in the composition of concrete to reduce the amount of cement needed and improve its durability. Pozzolans reduce absorption, permeability and ion diffusivity by reducing the porosity of the binder due to the formation of a calcium silicate hydrate gel from the pozzolan and excess Ca(OH)2 coming from the Portland cement. The amount of pozzolans introduced varies, from 5 to 40 wt.% of the cement. The typical natural pozzolans are metakaolin , pumice and natural zeolites , while the most popular commercial material used as a pozzolan in the concrete industry is silica fume and fly ash [,]. Different waste-origin pozzolans are being intensively researched as alternatives to existing ones, and the most promising are calcined clay and glass waste, different types of ashes including coal bottom ash, which could reduce the total cement content by 20 wt.%, retaining the given strength class and also reducing concrete cost by 9%. The major concern regarding the use of waste glass as supplementary cementitious materials are alkali content. It is concluded that alkali content within glasses should be limited to a maximum of 4%. This is why in this research two types of glasses were evaluated regarding to its alkali content - low alkali glass (<4%) and high alkali content glass (>4%).The material of interest is:

Contribution of acrylic fibre addition and ground granulated blast furnace slag on the properties of lightweight concrete
Abstract:
AbstractThe experimental investigation concerning the mechanical performance, drying shrinkage and residual strength upon heat exposure of acrylic fibre reinforced lightweight oil palm shell concrete (OPSC) containing ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is reported. The addition of 0.1% acrylic fibres in OPSC containing 20% GGBS was found to be the most effective in enhancing the tensile strength. The addition of acrylic fibres in OPSC was also found to reduce the 60-day drying shrinkage strains by up to 10% and improve the relative residual strength by up to 23%. Generally, the OPSC containing 20% GGBS had superior performance among the investigated hardened OPSC properties, except for the residual strength upon heat exposure, in which mixes with 70% GGBS achieved lower strength loss.The material of interest is:

Title:
Strength and durability characteristics of copper tailing concrete
Abstract:
Solid waste disposal is a worldwide problem. If not properly disposed, these materials become sources of environmental pollution and the problems related to it. Various studies are done worldwide to dispose these solid waste materials by using them for partial or complete replacement of aggregates in cement concrete. Copper tailing is the solid waste material left during the purification of the precious copper from the copper ores. Disposal of these waste tailings are very essential as it destroys the ecological environment. This paper investigates the suitability of copper tailing in cement concrete as a partial replacement of natural river sand. M25 grade of concrete is designed as per IS:10262-2010, with water/cement ratios of 0.4, 0.45 and 0.5. 0% to 60% substitution of fine aggregates was done with copper tailings. The specimens with 0% copper tailing was taken as control mix. Tests were done to determine the compressive strength, flexural strength, pull-off strength, abrasion resistance, drying shrinkage, air and water permeability, rapid chloride permeability, alkalinity and resistance to sulphate attack in concrete specimens. It was observed that Copper tailing may be utilised for the partial replacement for natural fine aggregates till 60% replacement, with water-cement ratios 0.4, 0.45 and 0.50. As the copper tailing concrete (up to 60% substitution) exhibited good strength and durability characteristics, it may be recommended for all construction activities.The material of interest is:

Title:
Geopolymer synthetized from bottom coal ash and calcined paper sludge
Abstract:
AbstractThis study deals with the development of geopolymers synthetized from industrial waste containing aluminosilicates. Geopolymers are inorganic polymers formed by the activation of amorphous aluminosilicates (Al2O3.SiO2), which react in a strongly alkaline medium. Bottom ash (SiO2/Al2O3Â =Â 3.3â4.5) was used as source of aluminosilicate and sodium hydroxide (NaOHÂ =Â 5, 10 and 15Â M) and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3, SiO2/Na2OÂ =Â 1.58) were used as alkaline medium. Calcined paper sludge was used to increase the reactivity of the partially crystallized bottom ash. The solid waste was characterized by XRF and XRD and the geopolymer samples were characterized by XRF, XRD, SEM, FTIR and compressive strength tests. The best results were obtained with a solution of 15Â M NaOH and sodium silicate and a mixture of 2:1 bottom ash and calcined paper sludge.The material of interest is:

Title:
The role of SiO2 nanoparticles and ground granulated blast furnace slag admixtures on physical, thermal and mechanical properties of self compacting concrete
Abstract:
In this work, strength assessments and percentage of water absorption of self compacting concrete containing ground granulated blast furnace slag and SiO2 nanoparticles as binder have been investigated. Portland cement was replaced by different amounts of ground granulated blast furnace slag and the properties of concrete specimens were investigated. Although it negatively impacts the physical and mechanical properties of concrete at early ages of curing, ground granulated blast furnace slag was found to improve the physical and mechanical properties of concrete up to 45 wt% at later ages. SiO2 nanoparticles with the average particle size of 15 nm were added partially to concrete with the optimum content of ground granulated blast furnace slag and physical and mechanical properties of the specimens were measured. SiO2 nanoparticle as a partial replacement of cement up to 3.0 wt% could accelerate C-S-H gel formation as a result of increased crystalline Ca(OH)2 amount at the early ages and hence increase strength and improve the resistance to water permeability of concrete specimens. The increased SiO2 nanoparticles' content by more than 3.0 wt%, causes the reduced strength because of the decreased crystalline Ca(OH)2 content required for C-S-H gel formation. Several empirical relationships have been presented to predict flexural and split tensile strength of the specimens by means of the corresponding compressive strength at a certain age of curing. Accelerated peak appearance in conduction calorimetry tests, more weight loss in thermogravimetric analysis and more rapid appearance of the peaks related to hydrated products in X-ray diffraction results, all indicate that SiO2 nanoparticles could improve mechanical and physical properties of the concrete specimens.The material of interest is:

Title:
Recycling steel-manufacturing slag and harbor sediment into construction materials
Abstract:
Mixtures consisting of harbor sediment and slag waste from steel industry containing toxic components are fired to produce non-hazardous construction materials. The fired pellets become lighter as firing temperature increases. At a sintering temperature of <=1050 degC, the fired pellets are in a form of brick-like product, while at 1100 degC, they become lightweight aggregates. Calcium silicate, kyanite, and cristobalite are newly formed in the pellets after firing, demonstrating that calcium oxide acts as a flux component and chemically reacted with Si- and/or Al-containing components to promote sintering. Dioxin/furan content present in the pure slag is 0.003 ng I-TEQ g-1, for the fired pellet consisting of slag and sediment, the content appears to be destructed and diminishes to 0.0003 ng I-TEQ g-1 after 950 degC-firing; while it is 0.002 ng I-TEQ g-1 after firing at 1100 degC, suggesting that dioxins/furans in the 950 degC-fired pellets have a greater chance to escape to atmosphere due to a slower sintering reaction and/or that construction of dioxins/furans from molten chloride salts co-exists with their destruction. Multiple toxicity characteristic leaching procedure extracts Cu, Cr, Zn, Se, Cd, Pb, Ba, As, and Hg from all fired products at negligible levels.The material of interest is:

Title:
Accelerated carbonation of biochar reinforced cement-fly ash composites: Enhancing and sequestering CO2 in building materials
Abstract:
Biochar produced from the pyrolysis of corn stover biomass was added as a filler material in the cement-fly ash blocks as 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% of total weight. The resultant blocks were subjected to two hours mineral carbonation at (3day) after demoulding to enhance the CO2 uptake and sequester carbon in the blocks. Along with that, 28days compressive strength of un-carbonated blocks was determined to gauge the effect of biochar as the filler material on the strength of the specimens. Results showed that there was an enhanced CO2 uptake on 3days compressive strength and biochar dosage was optimised at 4% and 6% depending on the chosen mix. The 28days compressive strength of un-carbonated blocks showed that there was an increase in the strength as biochar addition increased to a certain extent, however, thereafter it decreased with the further addition of biochar.The material of interest is:

Title:
Greening effect in slag cement materials
Abstract:
This article presents the first spectroscopic data describing the processes responsible for the temporary blue-green coloration that forms during the hydration of various materials containing Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS) under anoxic conditions. UV-visible-near infrared Diffuse Reflectance (DR) spectra demonstrate a striking similarity of the coloring center forming during the curing of a broad range of GGBS-bearing materials (pure GGBS with different compositions, mix Portland cement/GGBS (30/70), concrete and mortar). All spectra are similar to those of polysulfide complexes contained in the interlayer spacing of a synthetic green-colored hydrated calcium aluminate phase (AFm). This ""greening effect"" demonstrates a progressive oxidation of sulfide-based compounds initially contained in these materials during curing of GGBS bearing materials.The material of interest is:

Title:
Chemical interactions between siliceous aggregates and low-Ca alkali-activated cements
Abstract:
The chemical interactions between natural siliceous aggregates and a low-Ca alkali-activated cement (geopolymer) were studied. By leaching ideal aluminosilicate minerals such as kaolinite and albite in various alkaline solutions with or without soluble silicates, it was found that addition of 0.5M SiO2 to a highly alkaline activating solution ([OH-]0=5 to 10M) was responsible for the formation of an Al-enriched aluminosilicate surface through the initial non-stoichiometric and Si preferential dissolution of the parent aluminosilicates. This then facilitated soluble silicate deposition from the activating solutions onto the Al-rich surfaces, which resulted in the formation of a dense deposited aluminosilicate gel interfacial layer. This aluminosilicate interface formed during albite leaching ([OH-]0=5 to 10M and [SiO2]0=0.5M) was found to possess a similar Si/Al ratio to the real interface between a siliceous aggregate slice (basalt or siltstone) and a low-Ca fly ash/kaolinite geopolymer, activated with an activating solution of [OH-]0=10M and [SiO2]0=2.5M. Due to the similarities between the activating solutions used and the interfaces formed, it is postulated that a similar formation mechanism is shared between the deposited aluminosilicate interface formed from leaching and a 'real' geopolymer concrete synthesis. Without soluble silicate addition, or if a solution of low alkalinity ([OH-]0=0.6M and [SiO2]0=0 and 0.5M) was used, the Al-enriched reacting surface was not formed, and no deposited aluminosilicate interface was observed in these systems.The material of interest is:

Title:
Stabilization of Recycled Demolition Aggregates by Geopolymers comprising Calcium Carbide Residue, Fly Ash and Slag precursors
Abstract:
Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) is the by-product of acetylene gas production. In this research, the alkali activation of Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) was studied as an economical and low-carbon precursor for development of geopolymer binder. Recycled Concrete aggregates (RCA) and Crushed Brick (CB) are the two major demolition material sources for the Construction and Demolition (C&D) industry. The cement stabilization of C&D materials has been evaluated in recent years, however due to the large carbon footprint associated with Portland cement, geopolymers which utilize the alkali activation of industrial waste by-products have garnered increasing interest from industry. Evaluation of the geopolymer stabilization of C&D materials with CCR precursor were also compared with traditional Fly Ash (FA) and Slag (S) precursors. In addition, the performance of CCR based geopolymers with supplementary FA and S precursors were also evaluated. The three precursors (CCR, FA, S) were combined with contents of up to 10% for the geopolymer stabilization of the C&D materials. A liquid alkaline activator comprising sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used for the alkali activation of the CCR based geopolymers. The strength and durability of the geopolymer stabilized C&D materials were evaluated to ascertain their application in pavement bases/subbases. The results of Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Resilient Modulus (MR) testing of these geopolymer stabilized CB and RCA aggregates indicate that different mixtures of CCR based geopolymers can be used to improve the strength properties of the C&D aggregates for pavement base/subbase applications. CCR + 5% S with the C&D materials resulted in the optimum combination for CCR based geopolymer stabilization of C&D aggregates.The material of interest is:

Title:
Use of glass and nylon fibers in concrete for controlling early age micro cracking in bridge decks
Abstract:
One of the major defects in concrete bridge decks are the formation of early age micro cracking which ultimately reduces its durability. The inclusion of fibers in concrete slabs has showed satisfactory performance with improved mechanical properties and reduced early age micro cracking (EAMC). The relative high compressive strength (CS), achieved by using high cement content, is the main cause of early age micro cracking in concrete. The low tensile strength (TS) also results in less resistance to early age cracking. Other factors causing EAMC include temperature rise, water content and shrinkage strain. The EAMC can be reduced by increasing CS and TS with use of economical materials other than cement. In this work, mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) and nylon fiber reinforced concrete (NFRC) are determined for the application of concrete bridge decks. The effectiveness of glass fibers (GF) and nylon fibers (NF) in concrete will be checked by comparing mechanical properties of GFRC and NFRC with that of plain concrete (PC). The mix design ratio of PC is 1:3.33:1.67 (cement:sand:aggregate) with a water cement ratio of 0.71. The GF and NF having a length of 50mm and a fiber content of 5%, by mass of cement, are added in the concrete mixture for the production of GFRC and NFRC. Standard specimens are tested for determining compressive, splitting-tensile and flexural strengths of PC, GFRC and NFRC. Pre-crack energy absorption and toughness indices are also studied for different types of loadings i.e. compressive, splitting-tensile and flexural loadings. There is a decrease in compressive strength and an increase in splitting-tensile and flexural strengths of GFRC and NFRC compared to that of PC. Even though pre-crack energy absorption of GFRC and NFRC is less but their toughness indices are more than that of PC. Thus, GFRC and NFRC are suitable for reducing EAMC in bridge decks.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effects of crushed glass cullet sizes, casting methods and pozzolanic materials on ASR of concrete blocks
Abstract:
The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of using different particle sizes of recycled glass, casting methods and pozzolanic materials in reducing the expansion due to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) of concrete blocks prepared with the use of crushed glass as fine aggregate. In this work, 25x25x285mm mortar bar specimens were prepared using conventional wet-mixed and dry-mixed methods. Except for the control mortar bar, all the specimens were prepared by completely replacing river sand with different particle sizes of recycled glass. In addition, the influence of fly ash (PFA) and metakaolin (MK) content on the reduction of ASR expansion was also investigated. The flexural strength of the mortar bar specimens before and after they had been exposed to 1N NaOH solution was determined to complement the results of ASR expansion test. SEM was performed to examine the microstructure as well as nature of the cement binder-glass interfacial zone. The results reveal that ASR expansion reduced with reducing particle size of glass used. For the same given mix proportion, the dry-mixed method resulted in 44% less expansion when compared with the wet-mixed method. Both PFA and MK were demonstrated to be able to significantly reduce ASR expansion of the concrete glass blocks.The material of interest is:

Title:
Workability and strength behaviour of concrete with cold-bonded fly ash aggregate
Abstract:
This paper discusses the development of empirical models for workability and compressive strength of cold-bonded fly ash aggregate concrete in terms of mixture proportioning variables such as cement content, water content and volume fraction of cold-bonded aggregate through statistically designed experiments based on Response Surface Methodology. Factor level of cement is taken from 250 to 450 kg/m3 to introduce weak as well as strong matrix phase in the concrete. Apart from water content, workability of concrete is highly influenced by main and interaction effect of volume fraction of cold-bonded aggregate in the composition. Response surface indicate that increase in cement content causes to change the predominant failure mode from mortar failure to aggregate fracture and concrete strength decreases with increase in volume fraction of aggregate at higher cement contents. The models developed have been found useful in arriving typical relationship to establish a mixture proportioning methodology for cold-bonded fly ash aggregate concrete.The material of interest is:

Effect of s, fly ash and limestone powder on preplaced aggregate concrete mechanical properties and reinforced beam shear capacity
Abstract:
A laboratory investigation on the effect of s, fly ash, and limestone powder on mechanical properties of preplaced aggregate concrete (PAC) and shear strength of reinforced PAC beams without stirrups was conducted. S, fly ash and limestone powder is varied in each mixture to show their effects on the mechanical and structural strength properties of PAC. Ten reinforced PAC beams were cast, with PAC compressive strength ranging from 9.7MPa to 35.8MPa. From the same mix proportions, PAC slab members were cast to show an example application of PAC in the precast concrete industry. Beams were load tested in a four-point loading configuration with shear span to depth ratio (a/d) of 2.5, while slabs were loaded in equal 1/3 points. Load bearing performances of beams were evaluated based on load at first flexural cracking and ultimate shear load capacity. It was found that sand reduces workability of PAC grouts, but could be compensated by adding fly ash, while no significant fresh property effects were observed when cement was replaced with limestone powder. PAC mechanical strength had been shown to decrease as more cement was replaced with limestone powder. Modulus of rupture and ultimate shear strength of PAC beam members without stirrups can be designed using ACI 318-14 provisions. Finite element simulation using Vector2 can predict the ultimate shear strength of beam members. PAC example application through PAC slab members has shown similar performance at a lower concrete cost.The material of interest is:

Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of using limestone powder and Shirasu natural pozzolan, as partial replacements for fine aggregate, on the mechanical properties and resistance of concrete to an aggressive solution containing 3% H2SO4 and 5% MgCl2. The data show that replacing 5% of the fine aggregate with limestone powder results in more severe deterioration of the concrete by the chemical solution. However, replacing 55% of the fine aggregate with Shirasu both increases compressive strength after a 28-day cure and improves chemical resistance of concrete. In addition, the deterioration mechanism of concrete immersed in the aggressive solution was examined in this study.The material of interest is:

The effect of using natural zeolite on the properties and hydration characteristics of blended cements
Abstract:
In this study, various properties and the hydration mechanisms of cements containing natural zeolite were investigated. In the first stage a complete physical, chemical, mineralogical, molecular characterization of the zeolite and cement was performed. In the second stage, the mechanical and physical properties of blended cements, incorporating 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% zeolite by weight were determined. Finally, the hydration rate and products of cement pastes were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 28days. As it is concluded, the examined zeolite consists mainly of cliniptilolite, which reacts with the Ca(OH)2 generated during the hydration of Portland cement to form cement-like hydrated products. Finally, the addition of zeolite has affected the physical and mechanical properties of the blended cements depending on the amount of zeolite.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effect of new mixing method of glass powder as cement replacement on mechanical behavior of concrete
Abstract:
This study investigates the effects of using local wastes of Glass Powder (produced from crushing the glass waste) as replacement of cement in fresh and hardened concrete. Four percentages of Glass Powder (GP) were used: 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%. Two mixing methods were used in the study. First, the conventional mixing method, where the glass powder was added with the cement and aggregates. Second, the glass powder was dissolved in water before adding it to cement and aggregates. The slump increased as the glass powder replacement increased in the concrete due to the presence of more free water in the structure, which leaded to have lower density and higher water absorption. As a result, the compressive strength of conventional mixes method decreased as the glass powder increased at early age. Later, after 90 days, the highest compressive strength was obtained for the 20% GP. The new mixing method showed higher compressive strength than the conventional mixing method. Using 10% GP in the new mixing method gave a significant increase, around 130% of the compressive strength of the control mix. This increase can be related to the hydrolysis of the glass powder into free ions of SiO2, CaO and Na2O in the water which formed more CSH. The relative index proves the rise of the glass powder reactivity as the amount of glass powder increases.The material of interest is:

Use of increasing amounts of bagasse ash waste to produce self-compacting concrete by adding limestone powder waste
Abstract:
Bagasse ash is an abundantly available combustion by-product in the sugarcane industry. We examined the effect of adding limestone powder to self-compacting concrete mixtures in which large amounts of bagasse ash were employed as a fine aggregate replacement. A Type 1 Portland cement content of 550kg/m3 was maintained in all of the mixtures. The fine aggregate was replaced with 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100% bagasse ash and limestone powder by volume. Mixtures were designed to yield a slump flow diameter of 70+-2.5cm. The workability (slump flow, T 50cm slump flow time, V-funnel flow time, and J-ring flow) and hardened properties (ultrasonic pulse velocity and compressive strength) of each mixture were measured, and blocking assessments were performed. The volumetric percentage replacement of 20% limestone powder in fine aggregate incorporating 20% bagasse ash effectively enhanced the workability and hardened properties of self-compacting concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Use of pretreatment to prevent expansion and foaming in high-performance MSWI bottom ash alkali-activated mortars
Abstract:
This study has investigated the impact of foaming and expansion of municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash (BA) during alkali reaction. Furthermore, the activity enhancement of the BA has been investigated. Based on the microanalytic appearance and compressive strength of the samples, the results show that the reaction between the metallic aluminium in the BA and alkali in the activator, which produced large quantities of hydrogen, is the primary cause for both foaming and expansion. The residual organic matter and unburnt substances in the BA are the main factors that affect the activity. However, the alkali defoaming and calcination-melting pretreatments completely prevented the expansion and calcining further improved the BA activity. The alkali activated materials prepared with the BA calcined at 700degC, granulated blast furnace slag, and slaked lime followed by alkali defoaming pretreatment produced the best mechanical properties.The material of interest is:

It was found that when cured at 60 degC, specimens with replacements exhibited low compressive strength as compared to those without replacement. Conversely, when heated as from 1100 degC, both compressive strength and volume stability of specimens with replacement were improved. Thus, specimens without replacement were morphologically damaged at 1150 degC whereas those with 10% by mass of amorphous aluminium hydroxide or with 30% by mass of aluminium oxy-hydroxide showed good volume stability at 1150 and 1200 degC respectively. Additionally, geopolymers with 30% by mass of aluminium oxy-hydroxide that were heated at 1100 degC showed compressive strength of 29.1 MPa whereas those with 10% by mass of amorphous aluminium hydroxide gave 60.2 MPa at 1150 degC. This was attributed to the improvement of compactness of specimens along with the formation of stable crystalline phases. Yet, heating geopolymers at 1200 degC led to partial dissolution of nepheline and carnegieite which generates closed pores hence decrease of compressive strength. Partial replacement of amorphous aluminium hydroxide or aluminium oxy-hydroxide in the synthesis of kaolin-based geopolymers allows both improvement of compressive strength and thermal stability of heated kaolin-based geopolymers.The material of interest is:

Title:
Preparation of sulphoaluminate belite cement from fly ash
Abstract:
Sulphoaluminate belite cements containing the phases C2S, C4A3 S, C4AF, CS were synthesised from limestone, fly ash and gypsum at 1200 degC. The correspondence between the predicted phase composition and real phase composition were checked. The influence of quantities of different phases in the hydration behaviour and strength development were verified. Results show that an optimum proportion of phase quantities help in high strenght development in early age. These cements fulfill all the requirement of Portland cement and have very high early strength. Porosity measurements show that the total pore volume in early period is comparatively less than that of Ordinary Portland Cement. Thus these cements can be usable for special purposes.The material of interest is:

Title:
Biomass fly ash in concrete: Mixture proportioning and mechanical properties
Abstract:
ASTM C 618 prohibits use of biomass fly ashes in concrete. This document compares the properties of biomass fly ashes from cofired (herbaceous with coal), pure wood combustion and blended (pure wood fly ash blended with coal fly ash) to those of coal fly ash in concrete. The results illustrate that with 25% replacement (wt%) of cement by fly ash, the compressive strength (one day to one year) and the flexure strength (at 56th day curing) of cofired and blended biomass fly ash concrete is statistically equal to that of two coal fly ash concrete in this investigation (at 95% confidence interval). This implies that biomass fly ash with co-firing concentration within the concentration interest to commercial coal-biomass co-firing operations at power plants and blended biomass fly ash within a certain blending ratio should be considered in concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
The effect of waste rubber particles and silica fume on the mechanical properties of Roller Compacted Concrete Pavement
Abstract:
The current investigation discusses the potential use of recycled tire rubbers in roller compacted concrete pavement with the purpose of both improving its performance and reducing its environmental impacts. The main focus was on the basic properties of the roller compacted concrete, including the unit weight, the compressive strength, the flexural strength, and the water absorption of samples; thus, the particles of used tires were utilized as a replacement for the sand aggregate by 0, 5%, 10% ... and 35%. Also, the silica fume additive was used as a replacement for the cement material in eight mixes. The main point is that fresh specimens were compacted by a hammer, not a vibrator, in order to reach a homogeneous concrete. The results of the study showed an increase in the compressive strength of 28 days for different rubber contents 5% and 10%, without silica fume, and 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, with silica fume; however, the compressive strength was reduced for the other samples in comparison with the control specimen. Correspondingly, there was an increase in the flexural strength of 28 days for samples containing of 5% crumb rubber, with and without silica fume, although the flexural strength decreased for the other mixtures. Furthermore, the findings of the present investigation showed that the replacement of the sand by the used tire particles reduces water absorption, and this decrease was more obvious for samples with silica fume. In the final analysis, a regression model was defined to find a relationship between compressive and flexural strengths.The material of interest is:

Title:
The effect of high temperature on compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of structural lightweight concrete containing fly ash
Abstract:
In this study, the effect of high temperature on compressive and splitting tensile strength of lightweight concrete containing fly ash was investigated experimentally and statistically. The mixes incorporating 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% fly ash were prepared. After being heated to temperatures of 200, 400 and 800Â°C, respectively, the compressive and splitting tensile strength of lightweight concrete was tested. This article adopts Taguchi approach with an L16 (45) to reduce the numbers of experiment. Two control factors (percentage of fly ash and heating degree) for this study were used. The level of importance of these parameters on compressive and splitting tensile strength was determined by using analysis of variance (ANOVA) method.The material of interest is:

Title:
Improvement in corrosion resistance of recycled aggregate concrete by nano silica suspension modification on recycled aggregates
Abstract:
This work modified recycled aggregates (RAs) by soaking them in a nano-silica (NS) suspension and evaluated the modification effects on recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Firstly, different soaking times were studied based on the surface microhardness and the penetration depth of NS particles in the RA. Secondly, mechanical properties (e.g., compressive strength and microhardness of interfacial transition zones) and durability properties (e.g., steel corrosion and corrosion-induced cracking) were tested. The 1-h soaking modification was selected as the optimal soaking time. The nano-modification improved the protection of steel and the resistance to corrosion-induced cracking, which was believed to be related to the improvement of the ITZ properties according to the microhardness test results.The material of interest is:

Title:
Chemical interactions between siliceous aggregates and low-Ca alkali-activated cements
Abstract:
The chemical interactions between natural siliceous aggregates and a low-Ca alkali-activated cement (geopolymer) were studied. By leaching ideal aluminosilicate minerals such as kaolinite and albite in various alkaline solutions with or without soluble silicates, it was found that addition of 0.5M SiO2 to a highly alkaline activating solution ([OH-]0=5 to 10M) was responsible for the formation of an Al-enriched aluminosilicate surface through the initial non-stoichiometric and Si preferential dissolution of the parent aluminosilicates. This then facilitated soluble silicate deposition from the activating solutions onto the Al-rich surfaces, which resulted in the formation of a dense deposited aluminosilicate gel interfacial layer. This aluminosilicate interface formed during albite leaching ([OH-]0=5 to 10M and [SiO2]0=0.5M) was found to possess a similar Si/Al ratio to the real interface between a siliceous aggregate slice (basalt or siltstone) and a low-Ca fly ash/kaolinite geopolymer, activated with an activating solution of [OH-]0=10M and [SiO2]0=2.5M. Due to the similarities between the activating solutions used and the interfaces formed, it is postulated that a similar formation mechanism is shared between the deposited aluminosilicate interface formed from leaching and a 'real' geopolymer concrete synthesis. Without soluble silicate addition, or if a solution of low alkalinity ([OH-]0=0.6M and [SiO2]0=0 and 0.5M) was used, the Al-enriched reacting surface was not formed, and no deposited aluminosilicate interface was observed in these systems.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effects of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin on the morphology and mechanical properties of metakaolin-based geopolymer
Abstract:
Natural fiber-reinforced geopolymer has attracted wide attention in construction and building materials due to its low cost, low density, and excellent mechanical properties. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three basic components of natural fibres, and were investigated to reveal their influence on the metakaolin-based geopolymer. Comparative evaluations were investigated via morphology analysis and mechanical strength analysis. The results showed distinct microstructures and mechanical properties of the geopolymer-based materials with cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively. A low content (5 wt%) of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose enhanced the flexural and compressive strength of pure geopolymer. Higher lignin and hemicellulose led to the porous morphology, lower density, and brittle fractures of geopolymer-based composites, which reduced the flexural and compressive strength in these geopolymer-based composites. It was noted that the degree of geopolymerization was clearly lowered by the alkaline degradation of hemicellulose. With the increase in cellulose content, in contrast, the denser structure and fewer pores of the geopolymer matrix were detected, as well as ductile failures of geopolymer-based composites. Good bonding was also shown between the geopolymer matrix and cellulose fibres without remarkable degradation. The results of this study will facilitate a better understanding of the effect of lignocellulosic biomass in natural fibre-reinforced geopolymers and should serve as the basis for further research and applications.The material of interest is:

Title:
Geopolymer synthetized from bottom coal ash and calcined paper sludge
Abstract:
AbstractThis study deals with the development of geopolymers synthetized from industrial waste containing aluminosilicates. Geopolymers are inorganic polymers formed by the activation of amorphous aluminosilicates (Al2O3.SiO2), which react in a strongly alkaline medium. Bottom ash (SiO2/Al2O3Â =Â 3.3â4.5) was used as source of aluminosilicate and sodium hydroxide (NaOHÂ =Â 5, 10 and 15Â M) and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3, SiO2/Na2OÂ =Â 1.58) were used as alkaline medium. Calcined paper sludge was used to increase the reactivity of the partially crystallized bottom ash. The solid waste was characterized by XRF and XRD and the geopolymer samples were characterized by XRF, XRD, SEM, FTIR and compressive strength tests. The best results were obtained with a solution of 15Â M NaOH and sodium silicate and a mixture of 2:1 bottom ash and calcined paper sludge.The material of interest is:

Title:
High-alumina cement production from FeNi-ERF slag, limestone and diasporic bauxite
Abstract:
In this paper the utilization of ferronickel electroreduction furnace (FeNi-ERF) slag for the production of high-alumina cement (HAC) is investigated through laboratory and pilot-scale tests. The process followed consisted of smelting reduction of slag mixtures with low-grade diasporic bauxite and limestone. In the laboratory-scale trials the main process parameters were defined, concerning raw material proportions, kinetics of the reductions and cooling rate of the product. The presence of a carbon-containing iron bath enhances FeOx reduction from the slag. Products from laboratory tests developed satisfactory compressive strengths relative to those of commercial HAC. According to the results of the laboratory tests, pilot-scale heat treatments were carried out in a 5-t electric arc furnace (EAF) and about 4 t of final mixture were produced.The material of interest is:

Abstract:
The resistance of very high volume fly ash cement pastes and mortars activated by Na2SO4 has been monitored following immersion for up to 90d in 0.1M HCl, 4.4% Na2SO4 and ASTM-compliant sea water. Changes in the compressive strengths of mortars and in crystalline phases, bond environments, and the microstructure of pastes following immersion were monitored. Experiments were repeated with a commercially available sulfate resistant cement. Both cements were found to present adequate resistance to both sea water and the Na2SO4 solution. However, both were severely degraded by acid immersion.

Title:
Studies on concrete containing ground waste glass
Abstract:
The possibility of using finely ground waste glass as partial cement replacement in concrete was examined through three sets of tests: the lime-glass tests to assess the pozzolanic activity of ground glass, the compressive strength tests of concrete having 30% cement replaced by ground glass to monitor the strength development, and the mortar bar tests to study the potential expansion. The results showed that ground glass having a particle size finer than 38 Î¼m did exhibit a pozzolanic behavior. The compressive strength from lime-glass tests exceeded a threshold value of 4.1 MPa. The strength activity index was 91, 84, 96, and 108% at 3, 7, 28, and 90 days, respectively, exceeding 75% at all ages. The mortar bar tests demonstrated that the finely ground glass helped reduce the expansion by up to 50%. A size effect was observed; a smaller glass particle size led to a higher reactivity with lime, a higher compressive strength in concrete, and a lower expansion. Compared to fly ash concrete, concrete containing ground glass exhibited a higher strength at both early and late ages.",['concrete']

Results suggest a linearly decreasing influence of the amount of water on the mechanical performance of the geopolymer and showed that the majority of this water was not bonded to the structure. Moreover, it was found that whatever the amount of water initially introduced, all the samples contained the same amount of water after a drying period. The study of the porous network showed a large pore volume of 50% of the total volume which corresponds to the volume of water initially introduced. Finally, the observation of numerous macropore helped to explain the high transfer coefficients measured on the geopolymer.",['geopolymer paste']

Influence and mechanism of micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of concrete
Abstract:
The abrasion resistances of concrete in which the cement was partially replaced by 40 wt% super fine slag (SFS), 5 wt% nano-SiO2 (NS), 5 wt% NS and 25 wt% fly ash (FA) were tested. Mechanisms responsible for the affection of these micro/nano-mineral admixtures on the abrasion resistance of the concrete were analyzed through measurements of the micro-hardness of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of the aggregate-cement matrix and the cement matrix, the hydration products of the paste, and the degree of polymerization of the silicate chains of C-S-H in the paste. Results indicated that the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA improved the abrasion resistance of the surface mortar layer by 82%, 73% and 68%, respectively, and that of the concrete by 20%, 16% and 13%, respectively. Because of the addition of SFS, NS, or NS and FA, Ca(OH)2 was consumed to produce more calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and other aluminiferous hydration products, and the degree of polymerization of silicate chains in C-S-H was increased. Therefore, the micro-mechanical properties of the ITZ and the cement matrix were strengthened, improving the abrasion resistance of the concrete.","['cement mortar', 'concrete']"

Effects of crushed glass cullet sizes, casting methods and pozzolanic materials on ASR of concrete blocks
Abstract:
The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of using different particle sizes of recycled glass, casting methods and pozzolanic materials in reducing the expansion due to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) of concrete blocks prepared with the use of crushed glass as fine aggregate. In this work, 25x25x285mm mortar bar specimens were prepared using conventional wet-mixed and dry-mixed methods. Except for the control mortar bar, all the specimens were prepared by completely replacing river sand with different particle sizes of recycled glass. In addition, the influence of fly ash (PFA) and metakaolin (MK) content on the reduction of ASR expansion was also investigated. The flexural strength of the mortar bar specimens before and after they had been exposed to 1N NaOH solution was determined to complement the results of ASR expansion test. SEM was performed to examine the microstructure as well as nature of the cement binder-glass interfacial zone. The results reveal that ASR expansion reduced with reducing particle size of glass used. For the same given mix proportion, the dry-mixed method resulted in 44% less expansion when compared with the wet-mixed method. Both PFA and MK were demonstrated to be able to significantly reduce ASR expansion of the concrete glass blocks.",['cement mortar']

Preparation of the saving-energy sulphoaluminate cement using MSWI fly ash
Abstract:
MSWI fly ash was used as a major cement raw material in sintering sulphoaluminate cement clinker successfully in the laboratory. Sintering system, mechanical performance, hydration process and microstructure of the clinker was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), etc. The result shows that the clinker can be sintered properly under the temperature of 1200-1300 degC and sintered time of 120 min. Cl- content in the clinker made with MSWI fly ash is about 1.08%. However most Cl- cannot leach out in water solution from the hardened cement paste during curing age between 1 d and 28 d because of the Cl- being combined in clinker minerals and its hydrates. The compressive strength of the sulphoaluminate cement was high in early age while that developed smoothly in later age.",['sulphoaluminate cement']

Title:
A review on different methods of activating tailings to improve their cementitious property as cemented paste and reusability
Abstract:
Over the past few decades, as demand for minerals and metals has increased, the amount and volume of wastes and tailings has also increased dramatically. The management and reuse of mineral wastes and tailings not only help protect the environment but also are properly associated with economic benefits. As a result, mineral processing wastes disposal and storage has become a global issue. Along with the use of cemented paste as a backfill in underground spaces, the use of mineral processing wastes in the construction industry or as a substitute for cement is one of the new approaches to mineral tailings management. It is worth noting that the cement industry is facing crucial environmental issues. Portland cement production in industries increases the greenhouse effect and creates acidic rain. In fact, it generates greenhouse gases directly through carbon dioxide emission during clinker production as well as through energy consumption. In addition, the increasing stringency of environmental regulations has forced the mining industries to make efforts in order to manage tailings. One of the new and attractive techniques to reduce environmental problems and to obtain economic and technological benefits is to increase the use of tailings, for example, the use of mineral tailings as a substitute for cement. It is important to note that mineral tailings are not normally cemented and are accompanied by reduced strength of cement and concrete mortars; thus, there is a need for methods to increase their cementitious properties. Activation is one of the methods improving cementitious/pozzolanic properties of mineral tailings. Therefore, the present review study aimed to investigate the activation methods to improve the properties of tailings resulted from minerals processing in order to be used as a replacement for cement, to reduce the pollution caused by cement production, as well as to reduce the volume of unused mineral tailings. Different physical, chemical, and thermal activation methods were examined, and criticisms and research gaps of previous studies were presented.",['cement paste']

Title:
Experimental investigation of the effect of silica fume on the thermal spalling of reactive powder concrete
Abstract:
The distinct spalling performances of reactive powder concrete (RPC) specimens with various silica fume (SF) contents exposed to high temperatures were observed via high-resolution photography. The RPC microstructures and pore structures after high-temperature exposure were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results provide experimental evidence of the high-temperature spalling mechanism of RPC. Increasing the SF content in RPC increases its compressive strength and compactness, offering greater mitigation of devastating spalling behaviour, but also producing more pulverized spalling remnants. This is attributed to the post-heating cracked microstructure and refined pores, which promote localized rather than entirely explosive spalling.",['concrete']

Title:
Characterization of palm oil clinker powder for utilization in cement-based applications
Abstract:
Palm oil clinker (POC) is a waste material produced as result of using palm oil shell and mesocarp fibers as fuel to run stream turbines in palm oil mills. The current practice is to dump this waste in open land or landfill sites, which leads to environmental problems. The characterization of such waste to identify its suitability as a cement replacement materials, can ultimately lead to lower carbon footprint concrete. This paper presents the results of a study on the physical properties (particle size, specific surface, specific gravity, loss of ignition, morphology), chemical composition, organic carbon, thermal stability and mineralogical composition of palm oil clinker powder (POCP). The characterization was carried out using particle size analyzer, scanning electron microcopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), field emission scanning electron microcopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (FESEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques. From the laboratory works conducted results are defined and compared to existing literatures in tabulated form. The results of this extensive study on POCP characterization will provide guidance on future research work on utilization of POCP as a supplementary cementitious material in concrete.",['concrete']

Title:
Workability and strength behaviour of concrete with cold-bonded fly ash aggregate
Abstract:
This paper discusses the development of empirical models for workability and compressive strength of cold-bonded fly ash aggregate concrete in terms of mixture proportioning variables such as cement content, water content and volume fraction of cold-bonded aggregate through statistically designed experiments based on Response Surface Methodology. Factor level of cement is taken from 250 to 450 kg/m3 to introduce weak as well as strong matrix phase in the concrete. Apart from water content, workability of concrete is highly influenced by main and interaction effect of volume fraction of cold-bonded aggregate in the composition. Response surface indicate that increase in cement content causes to change the predominant failure mode from mortar failure to aggregate fracture and concrete strength decreases with increase in volume fraction of aggregate at higher cement contents. The models developed have been found useful in arriving typical relationship to establish a mixture proportioning methodology for cold-bonded fly ash aggregate concrete.",['cold-bonded fly ash aggregate']

Title:
Corrosion protection performance of microsilica added concretes in NaCl and seawater environments
Abstract:
In a hardened concrete structure, diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide, aggressive ions and moisture from the concrete/environment to the concrete/rebar interfaces takes place through the pores. This results in the failure of the passivation provided by the alkalinity of the cement to the rebars. Microsilica is a mineral that improves the corrosion protection and strength of concrete by reducing the permeability of the concrete and forming more calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) which provides strength and durability to concrete. In order to study the corrosion protection behavior of microsilica in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and sulfate resistant cement (SRC), carbon steel reinforced concrete specimens of above cements containing 10% each of densified (DMS) and undensified (UDMS) microsilica were exposed to 5% NaCl solution and seawater. Corrosion of rebars was monitored using open circuit potential (OCP) measurements. Diffusion of ions into the concrete was studied by salt ingress, salt fog and rapid chloride permeability tests. It has been noted that densified microsilica provides better corrosion protection to the rebars than the undensified one. In addition to this its protective effect with SRC is much more than with OPC. An attempt has been made to explain the mechanism of corrosion protection behavior of microsilica added concrete immersed in seawater and NaCl solution.",['concrete']

High-alumina cement production from FeNi-ERF slag, limestone and diasporic bauxite
Abstract:
In this paper the utilization of ferronickel electroreduction furnace (FeNi-ERF) slag for the production of high-alumina cement (HAC) is investigated through laboratory and pilot-scale tests. The process followed consisted of smelting reduction of slag mixtures with low-grade diasporic bauxite and limestone. In the laboratory-scale trials the main process parameters were defined, concerning raw material proportions, kinetics of the reductions and cooling rate of the product. The presence of a carbon-containing iron bath enhances FeOx reduction from the slag. Products from laboratory tests developed satisfactory compressive strengths relative to those of commercial HAC. According to the results of the laboratory tests, pilot-scale heat treatments were carried out in a 5-t electric arc furnace (EAF) and about 4 t of final mixture were produced.",['high-alumina cement']

The addition of 0.1% acrylic fibres in OPSC containing 20% GGBS was found to be the most effective in enhancing the tensile strength. The addition of acrylic fibres in OPSC was also found to reduce the 60-day drying shrinkage strains by up to 10% and improve the relative residual strength by up to 23%. Generally, the OPSC containing 20% GGBS had superior performance among the investigated hardened OPSC properties, except for the residual strength upon heat exposure, in which mixes with 70% GGBS achieved lower strength loss.",['lightweight concrete']

Title:
Investigation of the chemical, strength, adhesion and morphological properties of fly ash based geopolymer-modified bitumen
Abstract:
The current study seeks to investigate the chemical, strength, adhesion and morphological properties of fly-ash based geopolymer-modified bitumen (GMB). The geopolymer was prepared by mixing class F fly ash with alkaline solution (sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide), and was then mixed with an 80/100 penetration grade bitumen at different concentrations of 3, 5, 7 and 9% (by weight of bitumen) to produce the GMB. The chemical and strength properties of the binders were determined using the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Impact tests, respectively. The Surface Free Energy (SFE) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tests were conducted to establish the adhesion and morphology of the binders. The modification of base bitumen with geopolymer resulting the improvement in structural chain mobility properties and improved storage stability compared to those of the control sample. The result of FTIR analysis showed that the incorporation of geopolymer into base bitumen did not cause any change in the functional groups, where the peaks of aromatic C C stretching is at around 1600cm-1 (stretch), 1475cm-1 (stretch) and 900-600cm-1 (out-of-plane bend). The peak at around 1390cm-1 clearly shows the stretch of the C-N amine group. The result of SFE test shows that GMB has better resistance to moisture damage. Finally, the AFM analysis revealed morphological changes in all GMB samples. In general, the addition of 5% geopolymer can be considered as is the optimum concentration for bitumen modification.",['asphalt mastic']

Eight fly ash self compacting concretes of various strength grades were designed at desired fly ash percentages of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 85%, in comparison with five different mixtures of normal vibrated concretes (NCs) at equivalent strength grades. The durability properties were studied through the measurement of permeable voids, water absorption, acid attack and chloride permeation. The results indicated that the SCCs showed higher permeable voids and water absorption than the vibrated normal concretes of the same strength grades. However, in acid attack and chloride diffusion studies the high volume fly ash SCCs had significantly lower weight losses and chloride ion diffusion.",['self-compacting concrete']

Title:
Statistical models for the development of optimized furnace slag lightweight aggregate self-consolidating concrete
Abstract:
AbstractThis investigation aims to develop robust lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC) mixtures with furnace slag (FS) aggregates. A factorial design was carried out to mathematically model the influence of three key mix design parameters on fresh and hardened properties of furnace slag LWSCC (FS-LWSCC) mixtures. The parameters were water to binder ratio (w/b), high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA) content and total binder content. The responses of the derived statistical models were slump flow, V-funnel flow time, J-ring flow diameter/height difference, L-box ratio, filling capacity, sieve segregation, unit weight and compressive strength. Twenty mixes were prepared to derive the statistical models, and ten mixes were used to verify the accuracy of the developed models. The models were valid for mixes made with 0.30â0.40 w/b, HRWRA of 0.3â1.2% (by total binder content), and 410 to 550kg/m3 of total binder content. The influences of w/b, HRWRA% and total binder content were characterized and analyzed using regression technique to identify the primary factors and their interactions on the measured properties. Utilizing the developed models, three optimum FS-LWSCC mixtures with high statistical desirability were formulated and tested. It was possible to produce robust FS-LWSCCs that satisfy European EFNARC criteria.",['self-compacting concrete']

Study on the development of inorganic polymers from red mud and slag system: Application in mortar and lightweight materials
Abstract:
The conversion of red mud into valuable products remains an important issue to be addressed. Inorganic polymers from red mud and slag system were investigated. Slag was substituted at 25, 50 and 75% by red mud in the system. Sodium silicate solutions of modulus ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 were used and the samples were cured at 25, 40 and 60 degC. Slag was amorphous phase while red mud contained some crystalline phases, mainly hematite, crancrinite and katoite. A better reactivity, faster setting and lower shrinkage were obtained for higher contents of slag, with a modulus of sodium silicate solution of 2.0. The composition made of 50% red mud and 50% slag achieved a 7 days compressive strength of 54 MPa at 25 degC. The use of standard sand and hydrogen peroxide allowed the formation of mortar and lightweight materials with reduced mechanical properties, but still of interest to address both issues of sustainable use of resources and CO2 reduction in construction.",['mortar']

Abrasion resistance of alkali-activated slag concrete designed by Taguchi method
Abstract:
a b s t r a c t In this study, abrasion resistance of Alkali-Activated Slag (AAS) concrete was investigated according to ASTM C1138. Four affecting factors including curing temperature, alkaline solution to slag weight ratio, concentration of sodium hydroxide solution and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio were considered to achieve the maximum compressive strength and abrasion resistance of AAS concrete using the Taguchi design of experiment method. Based on the results, the mixture with alkaline solution to slag weight ratio of 0.45, sodium hydroxide concentration of 6 M and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio of 3, that had been cured at 95 C, and the mixture with alkaline solution to slag weight ratio of 0.4, sodium hydroxide concentration of 6 M and sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate weight ratio of 3, that had been cured at 25 C, were obtained as the optimal mixtures for maximum compressive strength and abrasion resistance, respectively. The results also showed that abrasion resistance of AAS concrete was significantly increased by improving the quality of surface and changing the curing regime. Water curing as an appropriate method improved the surface conditions and considerably increased the abrasion  resistance of AAS concrete too. In addition, the results showed that the CO2 footprint of AAS concrete was approximately 51% less than that of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete and therefore the eco-mechanical  performance of AAS concrete was superior.

Abstract:
This paper describes the investigation of the synthesis and improvement of the mechanical properties of quaternary epoxy-based polymer concrete (PC) using basalt fiber and clay nanoparticles. First, the effect of chopped basalt fiber on the compressive, flexural, splitting tensile and impact strengths as well as the effect of different temperatures (up to 250 degC) on the strength of fiber reinforced PC were investigated experimentally. Basalt fiber improved the mechanical properties and increased the thermal stability of PC. In the next step, the effect of nanoclay particles on the mechanical properties and the effect of high temperatures (up to 250 degC) on the strength of basalt fiber-reinforced PC (BFRPC) were analyzed experimentally. Nanoparticles increase the compressive, flexural and impact strength as well as the thermal stability but decrease the tensile strength of the PC. SEM analysis was performed to study the fracture surface and morphology of various concrete specimens. The resulting polymer nanocomposite will be used as a lightweight polymer concrete with high mechanical strength and thermal stability.",['concrete']

Data generated from tests on high strength fly ash concrete columns is compared with those of conventional high strength concrete (HSC) columns. The effect of concrete type, fire exposure scenario, fly ash, and fibers in concrete mix on fire performance of fly ash concrete columns is discussed. Results from fire resistance tests show that fly ash concrete columns exhibit almost similar fire resistance to that of conventional HSC columns. Further, the addition of polypropylene fibers mitigates fire induced spalling in high strength fly ash concrete columns.",['concrete']

Title:
Enhancing the thermal performance of Class F fly ash-based geopolymer by sodalite
Abstract:
Increased awareness and demand for fire safety of buildings are promoting research on fire-resistant materials, especially inorganic-based materials. One recent focus is geopolymers thanks to their high corrosion (acidic attack) and high-temperature resistance [1-3], in addition to their considerably eco-friendly characteristics. Geopolymers are formed by alkaline activation of aluminosilicate sources such as fly ash [4-5]. The lower water demand of fly ash-based geopolymers benefits in minimizing the damage caused by water evaporation during high-temperature exposure. Furthermore, compared to metakaolin-based geopolymers continuous sintering of fly ash particles triggered particle binding and strength increase with temperature increase. The aluminosilicate gel contributes essentially towards the high-temperature performance. However, geopolymers also release the physically and chemically bound water at elevated temperatures, which can destabilize the material structure and cause the thermal shrinkage and crack formation. Besides, the vapor pressure produced by both the physically and chemically absorbed water within the matrix will attempt to escape at elevated temperature. Thus, the level of thermally-induced damage is highly dependent on the pore structure of the material. Moreover, the research conducted by Ozawa and Shaikh showed that pure fly ash-based geopolymer did not exhibit the abrupt decrease in vapour pressure reported in cement-based and fly ash/slag-based materials, resulting in spalling and cracks, which may also demonstrate the advantageous utilization of fly ash in synthesis of geopolymer. Taking into account the enormous influence of the microstructure on geopolymer thermal degradation, the research focusing on the improvement of the matrix in order to address these issues is of great significance.",['geopolymer paste']

Title:
Study on solids-to-liquid and alkaline activator ratios on kaolin-based geopolymers
Abstract:
Kaolin and alkali activator were mixed with the solids-to-liquid ratios in range of 0.60-1.20 (Al2O3/Na2O molar ratio of 0.63-1.27). Sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide ranged between 0.16 and 0.36 (SiO2/Na2O molar ratio of 3.19-3.67) were mixed together to prepare alkali activator. The results concluded that compressive strength was affected by both S/L and Na2SiO3/NaOH ratios and strength increased with ageing day. Both these ratio also influenced the workability of the mixes. Besides, the kaolin geopolymers showed good volume stability in water. Compressive strength was highest at S/L and Na2SiO3/NaOH ratios of 1.00 and 0.32, respectively. In term of molar ratios, optimum was achieved at Al2O3/Na2O of 1.09 and SiO2/Na2O molar ratios of 3.58. Microstructures showed that kaolin particles were slightly activated with large part of unreacted raw materials remained in the system. Geopolymer sample reduced in peak intensities over time as presented by XRD analysis and the presence of crystalline peaks in the kaolin geopolymers was Zeolite X. FTIR analysis showed the presence of geopolymer bonding increased over age. In overall, kaolin geopolymers does not undergo complete geopolymerization and showed slow strength development. Vast research works have to be carried out to further improve the properties of kaolin geopolymers.",['geopolymer paste']

To reduce environmental pollution induced by the production of Portland cement-based building materials and eliminate the release of solid wastes from agriculture industry, this paper presents a newly-developed lightweight building material based on incorporating raw rice husk and foam bubbles in magnesium oxysulfate cement paste. Mechanical strength, bulk density, thermal conductivity and drying shrinkage of this material were carried out and phase composition, air bubble distribution and microstructure were studied on typical samples by using XRD (X-ray diffraction), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), OM (opto-digitial microscope) and SEM (scanning electron microscope) facilities. The results show that raw rice husk or/and foam bubble decrease compressive strength, thermal conductivity and bulk density. Compressive strength of this composite material at 28 days decreases from 70.4 MPa to 1.1 MPa when the bulk density ranges from 1722 kg/m3 to 450 kg/m3, being superior to traditional lightweight aggregate concretes. Drying shrinkage decreases with the incorporation of foam bubble and increases with the addition of raw rice husk. When the addition of raw rice husk is kept the same, there is an optimal dosage of foam bubble to obtain the lowest drying shrinkage. An excellent interfacial zone forms between raw rice husk and MOS cement paste due to numerous neat conical protrusions on the surface of rice husk particle. Therefore, this raw rice husk incorporated lightweight material has a great potential for applications to inner partition walls and thermal insulating components in buildings.",['lightweight building material']

Title:
Evaluation of tire rubber surface pre-treatment and silica fume on physical-mechanical behavior and microstructural properties of concrete
Abstract:
The increasing accumulation of tire waste has become a social environmental and public health problem because rubber degradation is extremely difficult to achieve and time consuming. The incorporation of rubber waste in concrete has become a recourse to assist in the disposal of this solid waste. This investigation evaluated the influence of a chemical pretreatment with sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) on the physical, mechanical, microstructural properties of concretes with two rubber residue contents (15% and 30%) as a natural fine aggregate replacement, and the addition of silica fume (7.5% and 15%) to replace Portland cement. X-ray microtomography and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the influence of treatment rubber and silica fume in the microstructure of concretes. The use of rubber in the cement matrix, regardless of the treatment (or lack thereof), decreases the concrete density (lower 10.5%) and compressive strength at 28d (54%), besides the increase the porosity (18%) than reference concretes. The rubber pre-treatment did not significantly influence the concrete behavior. In contrast, the use of silica fume showed significant compressive strength gains, up to 80% for concretes with 30% of rubber replacement at 28 days. These gains were confirmed by the microstructural analysis and the densification of the interfacial transition zone.",['concrete']

Accelerated carbonation of biochar reinforced cement-fly ash composites: Enhancing and sequestering CO2 in building materials
Abstract:
Biochar produced from the pyrolysis of corn stover biomass was added as a filler material in the cement-fly ash blocks as 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% of total weight. The resultant blocks were subjected to two hours mineral carbonation at (3day) after demoulding to enhance the CO2 uptake and sequester carbon in the blocks. Along with that, 28days compressive strength of un-carbonated blocks was determined to gauge the effect of biochar as the filler material on the strength of the specimens. Results showed that there was an enhanced CO2 uptake on 3days compressive strength and biochar dosage was optimised at 4% and 6% depending on the chosen mix. The 28days compressive strength of un-carbonated blocks showed that there was an increase in the strength as biochar addition increased to a certain extent, however, thereafter it decreased with the further addition of biochar.",['cement paste']

Title:
The effect of waste rubber particles and silica fume on the mechanical properties of Roller Compacted Concrete Pavement
Abstract:
The current investigation discusses the potential use of recycled tire rubbers in roller compacted concrete pavement with the purpose of both improving its performance and reducing its environmental impacts. The main focus was on the basic properties of the roller compacted concrete, including the unit weight, the compressive strength, the flexural strength, and the water absorption of samples; thus, the particles of used tires were utilized as a replacement for the sand aggregate by 0, 5%, 10% ... and 35%. Also, the silica fume additive was used as a replacement for the cement material in eight mixes. The main point is that fresh specimens were compacted by a hammer, not a vibrator, in order to reach a homogeneous concrete. The results of the study showed an increase in the compressive strength of 28 days for different rubber contents 5% and 10%, without silica fume, and 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, with silica fume; however, the compressive strength was reduced for the other samples in comparison with the control specimen. Correspondingly, there was an increase in the flexural strength of 28 days for samples containing of 5% crumb rubber, with and without silica fume, although the flexural strength decreased for the other mixtures. Furthermore, the findings of the present investigation showed that the replacement of the sand by the used tire particles reduces water absorption, and this decrease was more obvious for samples with silica fume. In the final analysis, a regression model was defined to find a relationship between compressive and flexural strengths.",['concrete pavement']

Title:
Effect of silica fume on durability of self-compacting concrete made with waste recycled concrete aggregates
Abstract:
Due to adhered mortar in recycled concrete aggregates, some of the properties of concrete made with these types of aggregates, such as water absorption, porosity, electrical resistivity, and chloride ion penetration, may be affected. In this study, silica fume was used as a part of cementitious materials to improve the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC), which were made with fine and coarse recycled aggregates. Three series of mixtures were made in the laboratory. In the first and second series, coarse recycled aggregates with replacement of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% were used with and without silica fume. In the third series, 25% of fine recycled aggregates were replaced with fine natural aggregates. Slump flow and J-ring tests were considered for fresh state of SCC. The compressive strength, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity, electrical resistivity, and chloride ion penetration tests were performed for hardened concrete. The use of silica fume improved the properties of fresh SCC. The results showed that silica fume can reduce water absorption and porosity. The silica fume showed that can resulted in a significant increase in electrical resistivity. On the other h, the replacement of 25% of recycled aggregates did not have a significant effect on electrical resistivity, the electrical resistivity decreased by increasing the amount of replacement. Silica fume was very effective in controlling chloride ion penetration and reducing total charge passed. Silica fume also controlled the temperature of the solutions used during the test which indicates the control of the movement of ions in the penetration into concrete.",['self-compacting concrete']

Title:
Evaluation of the sulfate resistance of concrete containing palm oil fuel ash
Abstract:
The effects of using palm oil fuel ash (POFA) as a new pozzolanic material on sulfate resistance in terms of expansion and loss in compressive strength of concretes exposed to 5% MgSO4 solution for up to 24 months were evaluated. POFA was processed to obtain different sized particles: small and medium sizes (SP and MP) were produced by grinding, and the large size (LP) used unground POFA. Portland cement type I was replaced by SP, MP, and LP at a level of 10-40% by weight of binder. Results showed that unground POFA (LP) is not suitable for use as a cement replacement in concrete because it produces low compressive strength and can not improve the sulfate resistance of concrete. Increasing proportions of ground POFA (MP and SP), caused a decrease in the expansion of concrete bars and an increase in the loss in compressive strength. However, the expansion and loss in compressive strength were reduced when the POFA fineness was increased. The results suggested that ground POFA (MP and SP) could be used as a pozzolanic material and could also improve the sulfate resistance of concrete.",['concrete']

The effect of using natural zeolite on the properties and hydration characteristics of blended cements
Abstract:
In this study, various properties and the hydration mechanisms of cements containing natural zeolite were investigated. In the first stage a complete physical, chemical, mineralogical, molecular characterization of the zeolite and cement was performed. In the second stage, the mechanical and physical properties of blended cements, incorporating 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% zeolite by weight were determined. Finally, the hydration rate and products of cement pastes were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 28days. As it is concluded, the examined zeolite consists mainly of cliniptilolite, which reacts with the Ca(OH)2 generated during the hydration of Portland cement to form cement-like hydrated products. Finally, the addition of zeolite has affected the physical and mechanical properties of the blended cements depending on the amount of zeolite.",['cement paste']

Title:
Evaluation of blends of high and low calcium fly ashes for use as supplementary cementing materials
Abstract:
The present paper outlines the results of a research attempt aimed at developing and evaluating the performance of ternary blended cements, incorporating mixtures of two different types of fly ash (of high and low calcium content). The main target of this study was to investigate whether and by what means, the introduction of a certain type of fly ash into a fly ashâcement (FC) matrix containing a different type of ash, can improve the performance of the initial binary system. For achieving this, new pozzolans were prepared by mixing, in selected proportions, a high lime fly ash with an ash of lower calcium content. The efficiency of the new materials was examined in terms of active silica content, pozzolanic activity potential, strength development, k-values and progress of the pozzolanic action by means of fixed lime capabilities. The results obtained demonstrated that the mixtures containing equal amounts of each fly ash were the most effective for moderate cement substitution, whilst for higher replacements the intermixture possessing the highest active silica content shows supremacy at almost all hydration ages. The superior performance of the ternary fly ash blends was mainly attributed to synergistic effects detected for all the ashes utilized. These were quantified in each case and almost linear correlations were obtained with the k-values of the most efficient ternary mixes.",['cement']

Title:
Nanoindentation study of calcium silicate hydrates in concrete produced with effective microorganisms-based bioplasticizer
Abstract:
The mechanical properties of concrete produced with effective microorganisms (EM)-based bioplasticizer are investigated by means of statistical nanoindentation, and compared to the nanomechanical properties of concrete produced with ordinary superplasticizer (SP). The resort to nanoindentation enables to survey the elasticity, hardness and long-term logarithmic relaxation behavior of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) after few minutes only. For each material, a cluster analysis of the experimental results yields groupings of indents likely performed on C-S-H with distinct packing densities. It is found that the addition of EM-based bioplasticizer improves the strength of C-S-H by enhancing the cohesion and friction of solid nanograins, and decreases the absolute rate of long-term relaxation. The statistical analysis of indentation results also suggests that EM-based bioplasticizer inhibits the precipitation of C-S-H of higher density. The findings of this work corroborate the results of a previous study which attributed an increase of homogeneity and a refinement of the crystalline structure of silicate phases to the effect of a biomodifier similar to EM-based bioplasticizer. The improvement of strength properties of C-S-H is also shown to coincide with a gain of compressive strength measured at the macroscale of EM-based concrete.",['concrete']

Title:
The effect of natural zeolites on the early hydration of Portland cement
Abstract:
In this work, the effect of zeolite, coming from Pentalofos area, Thrace, Greece, on the hydration of cement is examined. The experimental part comprises three stages: In the first stage a complete mineralogical characterization of the zeolite was performed. In addition, the pozzolanic reactivity of the zeolite was evaluated on the basis of Chapelle test. In the second stage, pastes of Portland cement, incorporating 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% per weight of fine zeolite were prepared. The pastes were water-cured at 20 degC, for 1, 2, 7 and 28 days. Finally, the hydration rate and products were studied by means of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in combination with thermoanalytical methods (TG/DTG and differential thermal analysis). As it is concluded, the examined zeolite consists mainly of ""heulandite type II"" and shows a good pozzolanic reactivity (0.555 g of Ca(OH)2 per gram of zeolite, according to the Chapelle test). The incorporation of zeolite in cement contributes to the consumption of Ca(OH)2 formed during the cement hydration and the formation of cement-like hydrated products.",['cement paste']

Improvement in corrosion resistance of recycled aggregate concrete by nano silica suspension modification on recycled aggregates
Abstract:
This work modified recycled aggregates (RAs) by soaking them in a nano-silica (NS) suspension and evaluated the modification effects on recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Firstly, different soaking times were studied based on the surface microhardness and the penetration depth of NS particles in the RA. Secondly, mechanical properties (e.g., compressive strength and microhardness of interfacial transition zones) and durability properties (e.g., steel corrosion and corrosion-induced cracking) were tested. The 1-h soaking modification was selected as the optimal soaking time. The nano-modification improved the protection of steel and the resistance to corrosion-induced cracking, which was believed to be related to the improvement of the ITZ properties according to the microhardness test results.",['concrete']

Efficient reuse of the recycled construction waste cementitious materials
Abstract:
This paper addresses the efficiently reuse of the recycled construction waste cementitious materials (RCWCM). The RCWCM is firstly collected, and then subjected to crushing, grinding and thermal treatments, respectively. After that, the obtained powder material is named dehydrated cement paste (DCP) in this study. Due to the fact that the DCP has relatively high pH value and high activity, two specific attempts are tried to efficiently reuse the obtained DCP. The results show that it is possible to produce a prefabricated building material with an industry by-product (fly ash) and a recycled waste material (DCP). The compressive strength of the produced prefabricated building material can be higher than 60MPa. Additionally, after being further dispersed, the DCP could be utilized as a high performance cement additive, which can significantly promote the hydration and microstructure development of cement.",['cement paste']

Ecological carbonated steel slag pervious concrete prepared as a key material of sponge city
Abstract:
A pervious concrete with carbonated ground steel slag powder as binder and crushed steel slag as aggregate was prepared, which provided the key material for construction of sponge city and explored a new approach to massively utilize steel slag. This paper presented series of experimental studies on the properties of steel slag carbonized consolidation matrix and carbonated steel slag pervious concrete. Results indicated that the phosphogypsum promoted the carbonization ratio of steel slag. When the content of phosphogypsum was 2.5%, strength and carbonization ratio of carbonated steel slag from pressing formation reached 82.6MPa and 52.1% respectively. The main product of the carbonated steel slag was calcite and C-S-H. The strength and porosity of carbonated steel slag pervious concrete reached 9.4MPa and higher than 20% respectively. And it also had a good plantability when it is used in sponge city construction. Compared with ordinary pervious concrete, carbonated steel slag pervious concrete saved 75.8% cost of materials, was 100% made of solid waste and absorbed around 100kg/m3 of CO2, which turns out to be a green and high-efficiency approach to utilize the solid waste steel slag, saving the natural resource and reducing the carbon footprint of the construction of sponge city.",['pervious concrete']

Use of pretreatment to prevent expansion and foaming in high-performance MSWI bottom ash alkali-activated mortars
Abstract:
This study has investigated the impact of foaming and expansion of municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash (BA) during alkali reaction. Furthermore, the activity enhancement of the BA has been investigated. Based on the microanalytic appearance and compressive strength of the samples, the results show that the reaction between the metallic aluminium in the BA and alkali in the activator, which produced large quantities of hydrogen, is the primary cause for both foaming and expansion. The residual organic matter and unburnt substances in the BA are the main factors that affect the activity. However, the alkali defoaming and calcination-melting pretreatments completely prevented the expansion and calcining further improved the BA activity. The alkali activated materials prepared with the BA calcined at 700degC, granulated blast furnace slag, and slaked lime followed by alkali defoaming pretreatment produced the best mechanical properties.",['geopolymer mortar']

Recycling of crushed stone powder as a partial replacement for silica powder in extruded cement panels
Abstract:
The continuously increasing amount of crushed stone powder normally coming from the production of crushed aggregates or sawing stone has led to an increase in the waste disposal costs or instances of improper disposal. In this study, the effective methodology to increase the utilization of crushed stone powder was studied by considering CaO/SiO2 mole ratio in mix design. The hydrothermal reaction to synthesis tobermorite related to strength development was also considered to improve rigidity in hardened cement. The results showed the optimized C/S mole ratio is 0.87 and a valid method for curing conditions relating to hardened cement was desired to be acquired by 2h of pre-curing, 4h of atmosphere steam curing (65degC) and 4h of autoclave curing (180degC, 10atm). The extruded panels satisfied all performance requirements relating to fire resistance as well as sound insulation and can have a possible application to building materials. The main findings of this investigation revealed that the stable crystal formation of tobermorite by the hydrothermal synthesis reaction affects the most important mechanism in hardened cement and mix design by considering C/S mole rate in addition to the analysis of microstructures promotes the recycling of crushed stone powder for building materials.",['cement paste']

Title:
Evaluation of Industrial by-products as pozzolans: A road map for use in concrete production
Abstract:
According to the Resource Efficiency Roadmap, the building sector is one of the key sectors addressing the challenges of energy, climate change and resource efficiency. The presence of legally binding guidelines in EU legislation regarding waste has already contributed significantly to waste management practices and innovations in the field of recycling; it has also limited the landfilling process and created incentives to change consumer habits. Thus, it is important to focus on the efficient use of resources by replacing commercially-available products with industrial by-products or waste materials. The concrete industry is the largest in the building sector, so the focus of reaching the targets mentioned above is in the daily scope for engineers and researchers. Reducing the costly and environmentally aggressive Portland cement and increasing concrete durability are the targets that act as guidelines for concrete development. Both issues have proven to be partially solved by incorporating supplementary cementitious materials, also known as pozzolans, in concrete composition. Following the American standard ASTM C125, the pozzolans contain siliceous and aluminous materials, which possess little or no cementitious value but will, in finely divided forms in the presence of moisture, react chemically with calcium hydroxide at ordinary temperatures to form compounds possessing cementitious properties. Pozzolans are usually introduced in the composition of concrete to reduce the amount of cement needed and improve its durability. Pozzolans reduce absorption, permeability and ion diffusivity by reducing the porosity of the binder due to the formation of a calcium silicate hydrate gel from the pozzolan and excess Ca(OH)2 coming from the Portland cement. The amount of pozzolans introduced varies, from 5 to 40 wt.% of the cement. The typical natural pozzolans are metakaolin , pumice and natural zeolites , while the most popular commercial material used as a pozzolan in the concrete industry is silica fume and fly ash [,]. Different waste-origin pozzolans are being intensively researched as alternatives to existing ones, and the most promising are calcined clay and glass waste, different types of ashes including coal bottom ash, which could reduce the total cement content by 20 wt.%, retaining the given strength class and also reducing concrete cost by 9%. The major concern regarding the use of waste glass as supplementary cementitious materials are alkali content. It is concluded that alkali content within glasses should be limited to a maximum of 4%. This is why in this research two types of glasses were evaluated regarding to its alkali content - low alkali glass (<4%) and high alkali content glass (>4%).",['concrete']

Title:
Influence of seawater and blast furnace cement employment on recycled aggregate concretesâ properties
Abstract:
AbstractRecycled aggregates of mixed composition (MRA) may exhibit great variability in their properties, which in turn reduces their applicability. This study intends to extend the use of MRA in a broadened scope of applications by producing recycled aggregate concretes (RAC), which were mixed using two different types of cement, ordinary Portland cement and cement incorporating blast-furnace slag, and two types of water, fresh and seawater. The testing programme included analyses of the properties of concrete in its fresh (setting time and plastic shrinkage) and hardened state (physical, mechanical and drying shrinkage). The results showed that all of the physical and several of the mechanical properties as well as drying shrinkage were negatively influenced by the use of MRA. In contrast, however, the plastic shrinkage and flexural strength were improved. The use of seawater improved the mechanical properties, reduced setting time and increased drying shrinkage, however, it was found that the cement type was more influential on most of the properties. The use of seawater and cement with blast-furnace slag improved the performances of the RAC.",['concrete']

Title:
Recycling steel-manufacturing slag and harbor sediment into construction materials
Abstract:
Mixtures consisting of harbor sediment and slag waste from steel industry containing toxic components are fired to produce non-hazardous construction materials. The fired pellets become lighter as firing temperature increases. At a sintering temperature of <=1050 degC, the fired pellets are in a form of brick-like product, while at 1100 degC, they become lightweight aggregates. Calcium silicate, kyanite, and cristobalite are newly formed in the pellets after firing, demonstrating that calcium oxide acts as a flux component and chemically reacted with Si- and/or Al-containing components to promote sintering. Dioxin/furan content present in the pure slag is 0.003 ng I-TEQ g-1, for the fired pellet consisting of slag and sediment, the content appears to be destructed and diminishes to 0.0003 ng I-TEQ g-1 after 950 degC-firing; while it is 0.002 ng I-TEQ g-1 after firing at 1100 degC, suggesting that dioxins/furans in the 950 degC-fired pellets have a greater chance to escape to atmosphere due to a slower sintering reaction and/or that construction of dioxins/furans from molten chloride salts co-exists with their destruction. Multiple toxicity characteristic leaching procedure extracts Cu, Cr, Zn, Se, Cd, Pb, Ba, As, and Hg from all fired products at negligible levels.",['lightweight aggregate']

Title:
The influence of silica fume on the corrosion resistance of steel in high performance concrete exposed to simulated sea water
Abstract:
This investigation examined the influence of silica fume on the corrosion behaviour of steel in high performance concrete (HPC) by comparing the behaviour of HPC concretes with and without a 10% by mass of cement addition of silica fume. Reinforced concrete prisms (500 x 100 x 100 mm) with embedded corrosion probes were loaded in three-point bending to achieve a 0.3 mm crack and exposed to simulated sea water for up to four years. Corresponding prisms without induced cracks were also studied as controls. For the HPC with silica fume, pore size distribution measurements showed that after exposure to the simulated sea water, the hydration and pozzolanic reactions near the induced crack blocked almost all continuous pores in the 0.01 to 10 Î¼m range. This affected the type and distribution of corrosion products that formed by restricting the access of chlorides and oxygen to the surface of the steel. Thus, only magnetite (Fe3O4) formed and was confined the space provided by the induced crack, effectively plugging the crack. In HPC without silica fume, oxygenated corrosion products such as goethite (Î±-FeOOH) and akaganeite (Î²-FeOOH) formed in the induced crack region. The implications of these observations on the service life of high performance concrete structures are discussed.",['concrete']

Greening effect in slag cement materials
Abstract:
This article presents the first spectroscopic data describing the processes responsible for the temporary blue-green coloration that forms during the hydration of various materials containing Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS) under anoxic conditions. UV-visible-near infrared Diffuse Reflectance (DR) spectra demonstrate a striking similarity of the coloring center forming during the curing of a broad range of GGBS-bearing materials (pure GGBS with different compositions, mix Portland cement/GGBS (30/70), concrete and mortar). All spectra are similar to those of polysulfide complexes contained in the interlayer spacing of a synthetic green-colored hydrated calcium aluminate phase (AFm). This ""greening effect"" demonstrates a progressive oxidation of sulfide-based compounds initially contained in these materials during curing of GGBS bearing materials.","['concrete', 'mortar']"

Title:
Production of supplementary cementitious material as a sustainable management strategy for water treatment sludge waste
Abstract:
This paper investigates the application of Water Treatment Sludge (WTS), the main waste generated by water potabilization activities, for the development of a Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM). The waste has been processed by calcining at a temperature range of 600 degC-800 degC for one hour. Chemical, mineralogical, physical, and morphological characterization has been performed to identify the potential pozzolanic activity of the calcined WTS and validate the application as SCM. Compressive strength tests have been performed in cement mortars with 14%, 35%, and 50% replacement of Portland cement by WTS. The WTS is a non-hazardous and non-inert waste, composed of SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and contains essentially quartz and kaolinite. Results confirmed the transformation of kaolinite into reactive amorphous phase by calcining. WTS calcined at 600 degC shows great potential to the production of SCM, confirmed by the chemical and physical analysis and the evidence of pozzolanic activity. The mechanical properties of mortars produced with 14% and 35% WTS calcined at 600 degC suggests a promising application in the production of blended and pozzolanic Portland cement.",['cement mortar']

Title:
Comparison of alkaliâsilica reactions in alkali-activated slag and Portland cement mortars
Abstract:
Alkali-silica reactions (ASR) in alkali-activated slag (AAS) and Portland cement (PC) mortars were studied to compare their expansions and products. ASR expansions were measured following ASTM C1260 with modified curing and exposure conditions. Scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM/EDX) was used to characterize the ASR products in both types of mortar after 28 days of testing. The concentration of OH- in the extraction solution of all the mortars at different ages was determined by ex situ extraction method. The results showed that AAS mortars exhibited lower ASR expansion than the PC mortars when they were exposed to 1 N NaOH solution. The observation of ASR products in the AAS mortars under water and steam exposure conditions supported the presence of their minor ASR expansions, which were not observed in the corresponding PC mortars. SEM/EDX observation and analyses demonstrated obviously different morphologies of AAS mortars under different exposure conditions. The lower ASR expansion of mortars can be explained by their lower concentration of OH- in the extraction solution, which might reflect the relative alkalinity in their pore solution.",['cement mortar']

Title:
Mechanical Fracture Parameters of Cement Based Mortars with Waste Glass Powder
Abstract:
Glass is an amorphous solid substance with pozzolanic properties that can be used as a partial substitute for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in cement based composites. In the research conducted for this paper, the PC was partially replaced by fine-ground waste laboratory borosilicate glass (in mixtures where 5, 10, 15 and 20% by mass was substituted). Beam specimens with the dimensions 40 x 40 x 160 mm were prepared from each mixture. After demoulding, the specimens were kept under standard laboratory conditions. Basic tests were conducted at the age of 7, 28, 56, and 90 days: the compressive (f c) and flexural (f f) strengths were determined according to the CSN EN 1015-11 standard. Specimens were also subjected to fracture testing at the age of 28 days. The beam specimens with an initial central edge notch were tested in three-point bending. Load vs. displacement diagrams were recorded and modulus of elasticity (E), fracture toughness (K Ic e) and fracture energy (G F *) were determined. It was found, that strength increased with specimen age: at the age 28 days this increase was 12-33% in case of f c, and 6-15% as regards f f. The values obtained for almost all the parameters decreased with the increasing dosage of glass as a replacement for cement: compared to a reference composite this decrease was 22-40% in the case of f c, 24-28% for f f, 3-5% for E, 9-29% for K Ic e, and 30-50% for G F *; exceptions were recorded for glass replacement doses of 5 and 10%, where increases of 2-6% for f c and 8-10% for E were obtained.",['cement mortar']

Title:
Potassium geopolymer foams made with silica fume pore forming agent for thermal insulation
Abstract:
Porous potassium based geopolymers with a mutli-scale porosity were synthesized. Silica fume is introduced as an additive to the geopolymer formulation. The free silicon contained inside this silica fume is oxidized in alkaline solution, releasing molecular hydrogen which generates the porosity. Previous work has shown how the porosity can be controlled with temperature, repeated temperature cycles and the mass introduced. Using this protocol, homogeneous foams were made and then studied with scanning electron microscopy. In particular the foam expansion has been followed with time in relation to the microstructure. The thermal conductivity values of the foams were evaluated using a fluxmeter method. The effective thermal conductivities are comprised between 0.12 and 0.35 W m-1 K-1 for apparent densities ranging from 0.40 to 0.85 g cm-3. The corresponding calculated pore volume fractions are in the range of 65-85%. The interest of this material is that it combines the advantages of low bulk density and insulating properties with the characteristics of a geopolymer skeleton.

Abstract:
Sulphoaluminate belite cements containing the phases C2S, C4A3 S, C4AF, CS were synthesised from limestone, fly ash and gypsum at 1200 degC. The correspondence between the predicted phase composition and real phase composition were checked. The influence of quantities of different phases in the hydration behaviour and strength development were verified. Results show that an optimum proportion of phase quantities help in high strenght development in early age. These cements fulfill all the requirement of Portland cement and have very high early strength. Porosity measurements show that the total pore volume in early period is comparatively less than that of Ordinary Portland Cement. Thus these cements can be usable for special purposes.",['sulphoaluminate belite cement']

Title:
Effect of silica fume and fly ash on hydration and microstructure evolution of cement based composites at low waterâbinder ratios
Abstract:
The hydration process of ultra-high performance cementitious composite (UHPCC) is distinctly different from common concrete owing to its low water-binder ratio (w/b). The effects of silica fume and fly ash on the hydration process and microstructure were investigated via different characterization methods in this work. The results indicated that the hydration process could be accelerated at the beginning by addition of silica fume, and fly ash, on the other h, retarded hydration mainly in the dormant and acceleration periods. When they were incorporated together in cement, the result differed significantly from cement hydration at higher w/b (>0.35). As a result of Ca(OH)2 consumption by pozzolanic reaction, the porosity reduced (<4%) and the interface strengthened as the curing time increased. Nanoindentation results revealed that most hydration products of UHPCC were UHD C-S-H and unhydrated cement. The unhydrated cement particles were surrounded by UHD C-S-H, implying that the UHPCC had excellent mechanical performance and durability.",['cement paste']

Exploitation of poor Greek kaolins: strength development of metakaolin concrete and evaluation by means of k-value
Abstract:
In this paper, the effect of metakaolin on concrete properties is investigated. A poor Greek kaolin was thermally treated at defined conditions, and the produced metakaolin was superfine ground. In addition, a commercial metakaolin of high purity was used. Eight mixture proportions were used to produce high-performance concrete, where metakaolin replaced either cement or sand in percentages of 10% or 20% by weight of the control cement content. The strength development of metakaolin concrete was evaluated using the efficiency factor (k-value). The produced metakaolin as well as the commercial one imparts a similar behavior with respect to the concrete strength. Both metakaolins exhibit very high k-values (close to 3.0 at 28 days) and are characterised as highly reactive pozzolanic materials that can lead to concrete production with an excellent performance.",['concrete']

Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of using limestone powder and Shirasu natural pozzolan, as partial replacements for fine aggregate, on the mechanical properties and resistance of concrete to an aggressive solution containing 3% H2SO4 and 5% MgCl2. The data show that replacing 5% of the fine aggregate with limestone powder results in more severe deterioration of the concrete by the chemical solution. However, replacing 55% of the fine aggregate with Shirasu both increases compressive strength after a 28-day cure and improves chemical resistance of concrete. In addition, the deterioration mechanism of concrete immersed in the aggressive solution was examined in this study.",['cocnrete']

Title:
Effect of new mixing method of glass powder as cement replacement on mechanical behavior of concrete
Abstract:
This study investigates the effects of using local wastes of Glass Powder (produced from crushing the glass waste) as replacement of cement in fresh and hardened concrete. Four percentages of Glass Powder (GP) were used: 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%. Two mixing methods were used in the study. First, the conventional mixing method, where the glass powder was added with the cement and aggregates. Second, the glass powder was dissolved in water before adding it to cement and aggregates. The slump increased as the glass powder replacement increased in the concrete due to the presence of more free water in the structure, which leaded to have lower density and higher water absorption. As a result, the compressive strength of conventional mixes method decreased as the glass powder increased at early age. Later, after 90 days, the highest compressive strength was obtained for the 20% GP. The new mixing method showed higher compressive strength than the conventional mixing method. Using 10% GP in the new mixing method gave a significant increase, around 130% of the compressive strength of the control mix. This increase can be related to the hydrolysis of the glass powder into free ions of SiO2, CaO and Na2O in the water which formed more CSH. The relative index proves the rise of the glass powder reactivity as the amount of glass powder increases.",['concrete']

Title:
Synergistic utilization of red mud for flue-gas desulfurization and fly ash-based geopolymer preparation
Abstract:
As an industrial waste characterized by huge volume and high alkalinity, red mud has become a serious environmental problem. The reuse of red mud has been explored in previous studies, including as building materials and for soil and waste water treatment. In this study, an innovation was made for the reuse of red mud to create a synergistic effect. Red mud was first used in flue gas desulfurization (FGD), and then the desulfurized red mud was again reused to make a geopolymer material. By using one type of original red mud and three types of fly ash, this study revealed that with high alkalinity and desulfurization capacity, the red mud could serve as an excellent FGD sorbent. After FGD, the sodium sulfate in the desulfurized red mud acted as a chemical activator for geopolymer made with class C fly ash. A 25% increase in strength was observed between the geopolymers with the red mud after FGD and with the original one. There are no significant benefits of FGD on the class F fly ash-based geopolymers and further study is required.",['geopolymer paste']

Title:
Stabilization of Recycled Demolition Aggregates by Geopolymers comprising Calcium Carbide Residue, Fly Ash and Slag precursors
Abstract:
Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) is the by-product of acetylene gas production. In this research, the alkali activation of Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) was studied as an economical and low-carbon precursor for development of geopolymer binder. Recycled Concrete aggregates (RCA) and Crushed Brick (CB) are the two major demolition material sources for the Construction and Demolition (C&D) industry. The cement stabilization of C&D materials has been evaluated in recent years, however due to the large carbon footprint associated with Portland cement, geopolymers which utilize the alkali activation of industrial waste by-products have garnered increasing interest from industry. Evaluation of the geopolymer stabilization of C&D materials with CCR precursor were also compared with traditional Fly Ash (FA) and Slag (S) precursors. In addition, the performance of CCR based geopolymers with supplementary FA and S precursors were also evaluated. The three precursors (CCR, FA, S) were combined with contents of up to 10% for the geopolymer stabilization of the C&D materials. A liquid alkaline activator comprising sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used for the alkali activation of the CCR based geopolymers. The strength and durability of the geopolymer stabilized C&D materials were evaluated to ascertain their application in pavement bases/subbases. The results of Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Resilient Modulus (MR) testing of these geopolymer stabilized CB and RCA aggregates indicate that different mixtures of CCR based geopolymers can be used to improve the strength properties of the C&D aggregates for pavement base/subbase applications. CCR + 5% S with the C&D materials resulted in the optimum combination for CCR based geopolymer stabilization of C&D aggregates.",['concrete pavement']

Title:
Chemical interactions between siliceous aggregates and low-Ca alkali-activated cements
Abstract:
The chemical interactions between natural siliceous aggregates and a low-Ca alkali-activated cement (geopolymer) were studied. By leaching ideal aluminosilicate minerals such as kaolinite and albite in various alkaline solutions with or without soluble silicates, it was found that addition of 0.5M SiO2 to a highly alkaline activating solution ([OH-]0=5 to 10M) was responsible for the formation of an Al-enriched aluminosilicate surface through the initial non-stoichiometric and Si preferential dissolution of the parent aluminosilicates. This then facilitated soluble silicate deposition from the activating solutions onto the Al-rich surfaces, which resulted in the formation of a dense deposited aluminosilicate gel interfacial layer. This aluminosilicate interface formed during albite leaching ([OH-]0=5 to 10M and [SiO2]0=0.5M) was found to possess a similar Si/Al ratio to the real interface between a siliceous aggregate slice (basalt or siltstone) and a low-Ca fly ash/kaolinite geopolymer, activated with an activating solution of [OH-]0=10M and [SiO2]0=2.5M. Due to the similarities between the activating solutions used and the interfaces formed, it is postulated that a similar formation mechanism is shared between the deposited aluminosilicate interface formed from leaching and a 'real' geopolymer concrete synthesis. Without soluble silicate addition, or if a solution of low alkalinity ([OH-]0=0.6M and [SiO2]0=0 and 0.5M) was used, the Al-enriched reacting surface was not formed, and no deposited aluminosilicate interface was observed in these systems.",['concrete']

Title:
Physical and mechanical properties of unheated and heated kaolin based-geopolymers with partial replacement of aluminium hydroxide
Abstract:
Amorphous aluminium hydroxide and aluminium oxy-hydroxide were used as replacements in the synthesis of kaolin based-geopolymers. Physical and mechanical properties of geopolymers cured at 60 degC and exposed at elevated temperatures (300-1200 degC) were investigated. It was found that when cured at 60 degC, specimens with replacements exhibited low compressive strength as compared to those without replacement. Conversely, when heated as from 1100 degC, both compressive strength and volume stability of specimens with replacement were improved. Thus, specimens without replacement were morphologically damaged at 1150 degC whereas those with 10% by mass of amorphous aluminium hydroxide or with 30% by mass of aluminium oxy-hydroxide showed good volume stability at 1150 and 1200 degC respectively. Additionally, geopolymers with 30% by mass of aluminium oxy-hydroxide that were heated at 1100 degC showed compressive strength of 29.1 MPa whereas those with 10% by mass of amorphous aluminium hydroxide gave 60.2 MPa at 1150 degC. This was attributed to the improvement of compactness of specimens along with the formation of stable crystalline phases. Yet, heating geopolymers at 1200 degC led to partial dissolution of nepheline and carnegieite which generates closed pores hence decrease of compressive strength.

Title:
Grey correlation analysis between strength of slag cement and particle fractions of slag powder
Abstract:
The particle size distributions of slag powder were investigated by Laser Scatter equipment. The influence of particle fractions of slag powder on the compressive strength of slag cement composed of 50% slag powder and 50% Portland cement was also studied by the method of grey correlation analysis. The results indicated that the volume fraction of particles 5-10Î¼m had a maximum positive effect on the mortar compressive strength of slag cement at 7d and the volume fraction of particles 10-20Î¼m had a maximum positive effect on the mortar compressive strength at 28d, whereas the volume fraction of particles larger than 20Î¼m had a negative effect on the mortar compressive strength at 7 and 28d.",['cement mortar']

Title:
Experimental characterization of binary and ternary blended-cement concretes containing ultrafine residual rice husk and sugar cane bagasse ashes
Abstract:
AbstractIn the present work an experimental program was carried out to investigate the influence of residual sugar cane bagasse and rice husk ashes (SCBA and RHA, respectively) in the properties of concretes. SCBA and RHA were produced using vibratory grinding in dry open circuit and conventional and high-performance concretes were produced with 0% and 20% of both ashes as cement replacement (by mass). Ternary mixtures containing cement, SCBA and RHA (0.6â0.2â0.2) were also produced in order to study the benefits of the simultaneous use of both ultrafine ashes on concrete properties. Experiments were performed to investigate the rheology (yield stress and plastic viscosity), compressive strength (at 7, 28, 90, and 180days), Youngâs modulus (at 28days) and rapid chloride-ion penetrability. The pore size distribution and adiabatic temperature rise of the reference and ternary mixtures were also evaluated. The joint influence of both ashes allowed reaching positive effects in rheology and kept constant or increased the compressive strength when compared to the reference mixtures. Moreover, the ternary concretes presented lower electric charges and the replacement of cement by 40% SCBA and RHA decreased significantly the maximum adiabatic temperature rise of conventional concrete.",['concrete']

Title:
The role of SiO2 nanoparticles and ground granulated blast furnace slag admixtures on physical, thermal and mechanical properties of self compacting concrete
Abstract:
In this work, strength assessments and percentage of water absorption of self compacting concrete containing ground granulated blast furnace slag and SiO2 nanoparticles as binder have been investigated. Portland cement was replaced by different amounts of ground granulated blast furnace slag and the properties of concrete specimens were investigated. Although it negatively impacts the physical and mechanical properties of concrete at early ages of curing, ground granulated blast furnace slag was found to improve the physical and mechanical properties of concrete up to 45 wt% at later ages. SiO2 nanoparticles with the average particle size of 15 nm were added partially to concrete with the optimum content of ground granulated blast furnace slag and physical and mechanical properties of the specimens were measured. SiO2 nanoparticle as a partial replacement of cement up to 3.0 wt% could accelerate C-S-H gel formation as a result of increased crystalline Ca(OH)2 amount at the early ages and hence increase strength and improve the resistance to water permeability of concrete specimens. The increased SiO2 nanoparticles' content by more than 3.0 wt%, causes the reduced strength because of the decreased crystalline Ca(OH)2 content required for C-S-H gel formation. Several empirical relationships have been presented to predict flexural and split tensile strength of the specimens by means of the corresponding compressive strength at a certain age of curing. Accelerated peak appearance in conduction calorimetry tests, more weight loss in thermogravimetric analysis and more rapid appearance of the peaks related to hydrated products in X-ray diffraction results, all indicate that SiO2 nanoparticles could improve mechanical and physical properties of the concrete specimens.",['self-compacting concrete']

Improved strength development and frost resistance of Portland cement ground-granulated blast furnace slag binary binder cured at 0Â Â°C with the addition of calcium silicate hydrate seeds
Abstract:
Cold weather is among the main challenges facing the construction industry in cold regions. Low ambient temperatures retard the early reaction process and strength gain of cementitious materials, thereby increasing the need for heating systems, delaying framework removal, and extending construction schedules. The American Concrete Institute (ACI) defines weather as ""cold weather"" when the air temperature is below 4degC for more than three consecutive days and is not higher than 10degC for 12h. These weather conditions last for at least six months in cold regions, drastically shortening the construction and infrastructure renovation season. This slows down infrastructure and urban development in cold areas considerably.",['cement paste']

Title:
Influence of recycled concrete aggregates on the flexural properties of reinforced alkali activated slag concrete
Abstract:
AbstractAlkali-activated concretes are a novel invention for substituting conventional construction materials; their main variation from conventional Portland cement concretes is utilizing comparatively alkali-rich, clinker-free binder matrix namely alkali-activated slag or geopolymer. Alkali-activated concrete is an environmental friendly and possibly considered to be a part of the sustainable development. Since, aggregates constitutes the major part of the concrete, there is a need to reduce the use of natural aggregate thereby reducing the exploitation of natural resources. This paper explains the influence of recycled concrete aggregates derived from the demolished concrete waste on the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete (GPC). Since, very few studies been conducted using recycled aggregates in geopolymer concrete under ambient curing, an experimental work was carried out involving mixes with varying proportion of recycled aggregates and their influence on the physical, mechanical and flexural characteristics of geopolymer concrete. The results infer that the inclusion of recycled aggregate improves the strength characteristics of geopolymer concrete.",['concrete']

Title:
Effects of silica fume fineness on mechanical properties of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes subjected to ambient and elevated temperatures exposure
Abstract:
This paper presents the effects of silica fume (SF) fineness and fiber aspect ratios of steel fiber on fresh and harden characteristics of high-strength lightweight concrete containing oil palm shell as coarse aggregates. The effect of elevated temperatures on the residual compressive strength of above concretes is also evaluated in this study. Three different SF fineness of 18 400, 21 000, and 28 000 m2/kg and 2 different aspect ratios of steel fiber of 40 and 80 are considered. Results show that the increase in SF fineness and steel fiber aspect ratio marginally affect the air-dry density of steel fiber reinforced lightweight high-strength concretes, however, the workability is reduced by about 9% to 14% due to increase in SF fineness. The compressive strength of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes at all age increases with increase in SF fineness and an improvement of about 37% is observed at 56 days by increasing the SF fineness from 18 400 to 28 000 m2/kg. Strong correlations are also observed between the strength improvement factor and the SF fineness. Water absorption of above concretes is also reduced by 3% to 14% due to increase of SF fineness from 18 400 to 21 000 and 28 000 m2/kg. The increase of SF fineness also significantly reduces the residual compressive strength loss at 300degC and 450degC. This loss of residual compressive strength is lower in lightweight concretes containing 16 mm long steel fiber than 8 mm long steel fiber. The existing Eurocode model overestimates the residual compressive strength of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes containing no SF, however, this discrepancy is significantly reduced with increase in SF fineness.",['lightweight concrete']

Abstract:
AbstractThis study deals with the development of geopolymers synthetized from industrial waste containing aluminosilicates.

Calcined paper sludge was used to increase the reactivity of the partially crystallized bottom ash. The solid waste was characterized by XRF and XRD and the geopolymer samples were characterized by XRF, XRD, SEM, FTIR and compressive strength tests.

Biomass fly ash in concrete: Mixture proportioning and mechanical properties
Abstract:
ASTM C 618 prohibits use of biomass fly ashes in concrete. This document compares the properties of biomass fly ashes from cofired (herbaceous with coal), pure wood combustion and blended (pure wood fly ash blended with coal fly ash) to those of coal fly ash in concrete. The results illustrate that with 25% replacement (wt%) of cement by fly ash, the compressive strength (one day to one year) and the flexure strength (at 56th day curing) of cofired and blended biomass fly ash concrete is statistically equal to that of two coal fly ash concrete in this investigation (at 95% confidence interval). This implies that biomass fly ash with co-firing concentration within the concentration interest to commercial coal-biomass co-firing operations at power plants and blended biomass fly ash within a certain blending ratio should be considered in concrete.",['concrete']

Chemical activation of blended cements made with lime and natural pozzolans
Abstract:
This paper deals with the chemical activation of lime-pozzolan cement (LPC), which consists of 80% natural pozzolan and 20% hydrated lime (by mass). Results show that the addition of 4% Na2SO4 can significantly improve the early strength of this cement. The presence of 4% flake calcium chloride (CaCl2.2H2O) is not helpful to early strength, but can increase the later strength substantially. CaSO4.O.5H2O and NaCl do not demonstrate an obvious effect on the strength development of the cement. Combination of activators, such as CaCl2.2H2O+Na2SO4 or Na2SO4+NaCl does not improve the activation effect; pastes with 2% Na2SO4+2% NaCl show lower strength than the pastes with 2% Na2SO4 alone.",['cement paste']

Title:
Microstructural and compositional change of NaOH-activated high calcium fly ash by incorporating Na-aluminate and co-existence of geopolymeric gel and CâSâH(I)
Abstract:
This study explores the reaction products of alkali-activated Class C fly ash-based aluminosilicate samples by means of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HSXRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and compressive strength tests to investigate how the readily available aluminum affects the reaction. Class C fly ash-based aluminosilicate raw materials were prepared by incorporating Na-aluminate into the original fly ashes, then alkali-activated by 10M NaOH solution. Incorporating Na-aluminate reduced the compressive strength of samples, with the reduction magnitude relatively constant regardless of length of curing period. The HSXRD provides evidence of the co-existence of CâSâH with geopolymeric gels and strongly suggests that the CâSâH formed in the current system is CâSâH(I). The back-scattered electron images suggest that the CâSâH(I) phase exists as small grains in a finely intermixed form with geopolymeric gels. Despite providing extra source of aluminum, adding Na-aluminate to the mixes did not decrease the Si/Al ratio of the geopolymeric gel.",['geopolymer paste']

Title:
Properties of self-compacting concretes made with binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of fly ash, blast furnace slag, and silica fume
Abstract:
Self-compacting concretes (SCCs) have brought a promising insight into the concrete industry to provide environmental impact and cost reduction. However, the use of ternary and especially quaternary cementitious blends of mineral admixtures have not found sufficient applications in the production of SCCs. For this purpose, an experimental study was conducted to investigate properties of SCCs with mineral admixtures. Moreover, durability based multi-objective optimization of the mixtures were performed to achieve an optimal concrete mixture proportioning. A total of 22 concrete mixtures were designed having a constant water/binder ratio of 0.44 and a total binder content of 450kg/m3. The control mixture included only a Portland cement (PC) as the binder while the remaining mixtures incorporated binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of PC, fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (S), and silica fume (SF). Fresh properties of the SCCs were tested for slump flow diameter, slump flow time, L-box height ratio, and V-funnel flow time. Furthermore, the hardened properties of the concretes were tested for sorptivity, water permeability, chloride permeability, electrical resistivity, drying shrinkage, compressive strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The results indicated that when the durability properties of the concretes were taken into account, the ternary use of S and SF provided the best performance.",['self-compacting concrete']

Abstract:
This research addresses the dynamic compressive properties of flax fibre reinforced polymer (FFRP) and glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) confined concrete under impact loadings. The investigations were performed by conducting impact tests using a high-speed servo-hydraulic machine, with the impact-induced strain rates ranging from 0.2s-1 to 30s-1. Plain concrete (PC), FFRP-PC, and GFRP-PC specimens were tested. The influences of FRP confinement and strain rate on compressive strength, stress and strain time histories were studied. The failure processes of the specimens were analysed via evaluating the high-speed camera photographs. The empirical relationship between the corresponding dynamic increase factor (DIF) of compressive strength and strain rate for PC, FFRP-PC and GFRP-PC were proposed based on experimental data. Experimental results of FFRP-PC and GFRP-PC specimens were compared to assess the confinement effectiveness of the FRP.",['concrete']

Title:
Use of glass and nylon fibers in concrete for controlling early age micro cracking in bridge decks
Abstract:
One of the major defects in concrete bridge decks are the formation of early age micro cracking which ultimately reduces its durability. The inclusion of fibers in concrete slabs has showed satisfactory performance with improved mechanical properties and reduced early age micro cracking (EAMC). The relative high compressive strength (CS), achieved by using high cement content, is the main cause of early age micro cracking in concrete. The low tensile strength (TS) also results in less resistance to early age cracking. Other factors causing EAMC include temperature rise, water content and shrinkage strain. The EAMC can be reduced by increasing CS and TS with use of economical materials other than cement. In this work, mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) and nylon fiber reinforced concrete (NFRC) are determined for the application of concrete bridge decks. The effectiveness of glass fibers (GF) and nylon fibers (NF) in concrete will be checked by comparing mechanical properties of GFRC and NFRC with that of plain concrete (PC). The mix design ratio of PC is 1:3.33:1.67 (cement:sand:aggregate) with a water cement ratio of 0.71. The GF and NF having a length of 50mm and a fiber content of 5%, by mass of cement, are added in the concrete mixture for the production of GFRC and NFRC. Standard specimens are tested for determining compressive, splitting-tensile and flexural strengths of PC, GFRC and NFRC. Pre-crack energy absorption and toughness indices are also studied for different types of loadings i.e. compressive, splitting-tensile and flexural loadings. There is a decrease in compressive strength and an increase in splitting-tensile and flexural strengths of GFRC and NFRC compared to that of PC. Even though pre-crack energy absorption of GFRC and NFRC is less but their toughness indices are more than that of PC. Thus, GFRC and NFRC are suitable for reducing EAMC in bridge decks.",['concrete']

AbstractIn order to evaluate the utilization of waste from coal combustion thermal power plant, the properties of lightweight geopolymer concrete (LWGC) containing fly ash as geopolymer binder and bottom ash as aggregates were studied.

The compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, surface abrasion resistance, density, thermal conductivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of concrete were tested. The results indicated that fly ash and bottom ash could be used to produce LWGCs with compressive strengths of 14.3â18.1MPa, splitting tensile strengths of 1.2â2.0MPa, and densities of 1661â1688kg/m3.

Cement has been successfully produced from the agricultural waste, rice husk ash. For this production, rice husk was pre-carbonized in a pilot-plant and was further decarbonized in an electric furnace to produce rice husk ash. 24.5% rice husk ash was mixed with other raw materials (sourced locally) for producing white Portland cement and the cement produced was used to make a concrete slab. The formulated cement slab, commercial cement and slab were tested for their physical characteristics and chemical composition. The results of tests confirmed that produced cement was of similar standard to commercial cement. Based on the results, the production of cement from rice husk has been recommended for developing countries since it would help reduce problems of rice husks as farm wastes.",['cement']

Title:
Geopolymerisation of silt generated from construction and demolition waste washing plants
Abstract:
Recycling plants that size, sort and wash construction and demolition waste can produce high quality aggregate. However, they also produce up to 80 ton per hour of filter cake waste containing fine (<63 mm) silt particles that is classified as inert waste and normally landfilled. This research investigated the potential to form geopolymers containing silt, which would allow this problematic waste to be beneficially reused as aggregate. This would significantly improve the economic viability of recycling plants that wash wastes. Silt filter cakes have been collected from a number of aggregate washing plants operating in the UK. These were found to contain similar aluminosilicate crystalline phases. Geopolymer samples were produced using silt and silt mixed with either metakaolin or pulverised fuel ash (PFA). Silt geopolymers cured at room temperature had average 7-day compressive strengths of 18.7 MPa, while partial substitution of silt by metakaolin or PFA increased average compressive strengths to 30.5 and 21.9 MPa, respectively. Curing specimens for 24 h at 105 degC resulted in a compressive strength of 39.7 MPa and microstructural analysis confirmed the formation of dense materials. These strengths are in excess of those required for materials to be used as aggregate, particularly in unbound applications. The implications of this research for the management of waste silt at construction and demolition waste washing plants are discussed.",['geopolymer paste']
