Title:
Influence of seawater and blast furnace cement employment on recycled aggregate concretesâ€™ properties
Abstract:
AbstractRecycled aggregates of mixed composition (MRA) may exhibit great variability in their properties, which in turn reduces their applicability. This study intends to extend the use of MRA in a broadened scope of applications by producing recycled aggregate concretes (RAC), which were mixed using two different types of cement, ordinary Portland cement and cement incorporating blast-furnace slag, and two types of water, fresh and seawater. The testing programme included analyses of the properties of concrete in its fresh (setting time and plastic shrinkage) and hardened state (physical, mechanical and drying shrinkage). The results showed that all of the physical and several of the mechanical properties as well as drying shrinkage were negatively influenced by the use of MRA. In contrast, however, the plastic shrinkage and flexural strength were improved. The use of seawater improved the mechanical properties, reduced setting time and increased drying shrinkage, however, it was found that the cement type was more influential on most of the properties. The use of seawater and cement with blast-furnace slag improved the performances of the RAC.The material of interest is:

Title:
Accelerated carbonation of biochar reinforced cement-fly ash composites: Enhancing and sequestering CO2 in building materials
Abstract:
Biochar produced from the pyrolysis of corn stover biomass was added as a filler material in the cement-fly ash blocks as 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% of total weight. The resultant blocks were subjected to two hours mineral carbonation at (3day) after demoulding to enhance the CO2 uptake and sequester carbon in the blocks. Along with that, 28days compressive strength of un-carbonated blocks was determined to gauge the effect of biochar as the filler material on the strength of the specimens. Results showed that there was an enhanced CO2 uptake on 3days compressive strength and biochar dosage was optimised at 4% and 6% depending on the chosen mix. The 28days compressive strength of un-carbonated blocks showed that there was an increase in the strength as biochar addition increased to a certain extent, however, thereafter it decreased with the further addition of biochar.The material of interest is:

Title:
Properties of self-compacting concretes made with binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of fly ash, blast furnace slag, and silica fume
Abstract:
Self-compacting concretes (SCCs) have brought a promising insight into the concrete industry to provide environmental impact and cost reduction. However, the use of ternary and especially quaternary cementitious blends of mineral admixtures have not found sufficient applications in the production of SCCs. For this purpose, an experimental study was conducted to investigate properties of SCCs with mineral admixtures. Moreover, durability based multi-objective optimization of the mixtures were performed to achieve an optimal concrete mixture proportioning. A total of 22 concrete mixtures were designed having a constant water/binder ratio of 0.44 and a total binder content of 450kg/m3. The control mixture included only a Portland cement (PC) as the binder while the remaining mixtures incorporated binary, ternary, and quaternary cementitious blends of PC, fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (S), and silica fume (SF). Fresh properties of the SCCs were tested for slump flow diameter, slump flow time, L-box height ratio, and V-funnel flow time. Furthermore, the hardened properties of the concretes were tested for sorptivity, water permeability, chloride permeability, electrical resistivity, drying shrinkage, compressive strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The results indicated that when the durability properties of the concretes were taken into account, the ternary use of S and SF provided the best performance.The material of interest is:

Title:
Influence of recycled concrete aggregates on the flexural properties of reinforced alkali activated slag concrete
Abstract:
AbstractAlkali-activated concretes are a novel invention for substituting conventional construction materials; their main variation from conventional Portland cement concretes is utilizing comparatively alkali-rich, clinker-free binder matrix namely alkali-activated slag or geopolymer. Alkali-activated concrete is an environmental friendly and possibly considered to be a part of the sustainable development. Since, aggregates constitutes the major part of the concrete, there is a need to reduce the use of natural aggregate thereby reducing the exploitation of natural resources. This paper explains the influence of recycled concrete aggregates derived from the demolished concrete waste on the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete (GPC). Since, very few studies been conducted using recycled aggregates in geopolymer concrete under ambient curing, an experimental work was carried out involving mixes with varying proportion of recycled aggregates and their influence on the physical, mechanical and flexural characteristics of geopolymer concrete. The results infer that the inclusion of recycled aggregate improves the strength characteristics of geopolymer concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Evaluation of the sulfate resistance of concrete containing palm oil fuel ash
Abstract:
The effects of using palm oil fuel ash (POFA) as a new pozzolanic material on sulfate resistance in terms of expansion and loss in compressive strength of concretes exposed to 5% MgSO4 solution for up to 24 months were evaluated. POFA was processed to obtain different sized particles: small and medium sizes (SP and MP) were produced by grinding, and the large size (LP) used unground POFA. Portland cement type I was replaced by SP, MP, and LP at a level of 10-40% by weight of binder. Results showed that unground POFA (LP) is not suitable for use as a cement replacement in concrete because it produces low compressive strength and can not improve the sulfate resistance of concrete. Increasing proportions of ground POFA (MP and SP), caused a decrease in the expansion of concrete bars and an increase in the loss in compressive strength. However, the expansion and loss in compressive strength were reduced when the POFA fineness was increased. The results suggested that ground POFA (MP and SP) could be used as a pozzolanic material and could also improve the sulfate resistance of concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Evaluation of blends of high and low calcium fly ashes for use as supplementary cementing materials
Abstract:
The present paper outlines the results of a research attempt aimed at developing and evaluating the performance of ternary blended cements, incorporating mixtures of two different types of fly ash (of high and low calcium content). The main target of this study was to investigate whether and by what means, the introduction of a certain type of fly ash into a fly ashâ€“cement (FC) matrix containing a different type of ash, can improve the performance of the initial binary system. For achieving this, new pozzolans were prepared by mixing, in selected proportions, a high lime fly ash with an ash of lower calcium content. The efficiency of the new materials was examined in terms of active silica content, pozzolanic activity potential, strength development, k-values and progress of the pozzolanic action by means of fixed lime capabilities. The results obtained demonstrated that the mixtures containing equal amounts of each fly ash were the most effective for moderate cement substitution, whilst for higher replacements the intermixture possessing the highest active silica content shows supremacy at almost all hydration ages. The superior performance of the ternary fly ash blends was mainly attributed to synergistic effects detected for all the ashes utilized. These were quantified in each case and almost linear correlations were obtained with the k-values of the most efficient ternary mixes.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effects of silica fume fineness on mechanical properties of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes subjected to ambient and elevated temperatures exposure
Abstract:
This paper presents the effects of silica fume (SF) fineness and fiber aspect ratios of steel fiber on fresh and harden characteristics of high-strength lightweight concrete containing oil palm shell as coarse aggregates. The effect of elevated temperatures on the residual compressive strength of above concretes is also evaluated in this study. Three different SF fineness of 18 400, 21 000, and 28 000 m2/kg and 2 different aspect ratios of steel fiber of 40 and 80 are considered. Results show that the increase in SF fineness and steel fiber aspect ratio marginally affect the air-dry density of steel fiber reinforced lightweight high-strength concretes, however, the workability is reduced by about 9% to 14% due to increase in SF fineness. The compressive strength of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes at all age increases with increase in SF fineness and an improvement of about 37% is observed at 56 days by increasing the SF fineness from 18 400 to 28 000 m2/kg. Strong correlations are also observed between the strength improvement factor and the SF fineness. Water absorption of above concretes is also reduced by 3% to 14% due to increase of SF fineness from 18 400 to 21 000 and 28 000 m2/kg. The increase of SF fineness also significantly reduces the residual compressive strength loss at 300degC and 450degC. This loss of residual compressive strength is lower in lightweight concretes containing 16 mm long steel fiber than 8 mm long steel fiber. The existing Eurocode model overestimates the residual compressive strength of steel fiber reinforced lightweight concretes containing no SF, however, this discrepancy is significantly reduced with increase in SF fineness.The material of interest is:

Title:
The influence of ion chloride on concretes made with sulfate-resistant cements and mineral admixtures
Abstract:
The aim of this work is to study the influence of chloride ion in the mechanical, microstructural and chemical properties of concrete. For this purpose, four concrete mixes were designed, with two types of sulfate-resistant cement and two mineral admixtures (silica fume and fly ash). Furthermore, a chloride binding isotherm is offered that is compared with Freundlich and Langmuir models. This provides certain advantages in reproducing experimental results. According to such results, the properties do not present significant changes in all cases. The concretes with blast-furnace slag cement and with silica fume are those that present the best performance.The material of interest is:

Title:
Prediction of properties of self-compacting concrete containing fly ash using artificial neural network
Abstract:
This paper investigates the feasibility of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) modeling to predict the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) containing fly ash as cement replacement. For the purpose of constructing this model, a database of experimental data was gathered from the literature and used for training and testing the model. The data used in the artificial neural network model are arranged in a format of six input parameters that cover the total binder content, fly ash replacement percentage, water-binder ratio, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates and superplasticizer. Four outputs parameters are predicted based on the ANN technique as the slump flow, the L-box ratio, the V-funnel time and the compressive strength at 28 days of SCC. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed model and improve its performance, a comparison of the ANN-based prediction model with other researcher's experimental results was carried out, and a good agreement was found. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted using the trained and tested ANN model to investigate the effect of fly ash on SCC properties. This study shows that artificial neural network has strong potential as a feasible tool for predicting accurately the properties of SCC containing fly ash.The material of interest is:

Title:
Characteristics of Australian brown coal fly ash blended geopolymers
Abstract:
AbstractThe present study evaluates the potential re-use options for a suite of low rank brown coal fly ashes (ASTM class C fly ash) as feedstock for geopolymer binder synthesis. Ash suitability was evaluated using a number of conventional characterisation tools including XRF, calorimetric and microscopy to analyse solid phase distribution in relation to compositional differences derived from ternary diagram analogues. Blends of brown coal ash with selected black coal fly ash (class F) and blast furnace slag were developed for compressive strength and durability tests. The study show that brown coal fly ash with higher Al content improved the rate of reaction of blended binders and that observed high contents of sulphate and magnesium oxides available in some brown coal fly ashes induced accelerated decomposition in high moist environments. Overall, it was evident from both microscopy and mineralogical analysis of binder mixtures that brown coal fly ash participate in geopolymer network formation rather than act as filler material. Factors influencing brown coal ash reactivity and the potential for incorporating this class of ash in developing stable and usable geopolymer binder systems are discussed.The material of interest is:

Title:
Ecological carbonated steel slag pervious concrete prepared as a key material of sponge city
Abstract:
A pervious concrete with carbonated ground steel slag powder as binder and crushed steel slag as aggregate was prepared, which provided the key material for construction of sponge city and explored a new approach to massively utilize steel slag. This paper presented series of experimental studies on the properties of steel slag carbonized consolidation matrix and carbonated steel slag pervious concrete. Results indicated that the phosphogypsum promoted the carbonization ratio of steel slag. When the content of phosphogypsum was 2.5%, strength and carbonization ratio of carbonated steel slag from pressing formation reached 82.6MPa and 52.1% respectively. The main product of the carbonated steel slag was calcite and C-S-H. The strength and porosity of carbonated steel slag pervious concrete reached 9.4MPa and higher than 20% respectively. And it also had a good plantability when it is used in sponge city construction. Compared with ordinary pervious concrete, carbonated steel slag pervious concrete saved 75.8% cost of materials, was 100% made of solid waste and absorbed around 100kg/m3 of CO2, which turns out to be a green and high-efficiency approach to utilize the solid waste steel slag, saving the natural resource and reducing the carbon footprint of the construction of sponge city.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effect of silica fume and fly ash on hydration and microstructure evolution of cement based composites at low waterâ€“binder ratios
Abstract:
The hydration process of ultra-high performance cementitious composite (UHPCC) is distinctly different from common concrete owing to its low water-binder ratio (w/b). The effects of silica fume and fly ash on the hydration process and microstructure were investigated via different characterization methods in this work. The results indicated that the hydration process could be accelerated at the beginning by addition of silica fume, and fly ash, on the other h, retarded hydration mainly in the dormant and acceleration periods. When they were incorporated together in cement, the result differed significantly from cement hydration at higher w/b (>0.35). As a result of Ca(OH)2 consumption by pozzolanic reaction, the porosity reduced (<4%) and the interface strengthened as the curing time increased. Nanoindentation results revealed that most hydration products of UHPCC were UHD C-S-H and unhydrated cement. The unhydrated cement particles were surrounded by UHD C-S-H, implying that the UHPCC had excellent mechanical performance and durability.The material of interest is:

Title:
Evaluation of Industrial by-products as pozzolans: A road map for use in concrete production
Abstract:
According to the Resource Efficiency Roadmap, the building sector is one of the key sectors addressing the challenges of energy, climate change and resource efficiency. The presence of legally binding guidelines in EU legislation regarding waste has already contributed significantly to waste management practices and innovations in the field of recycling; it has also limited the landfilling process and created incentives to change consumer habits. Thus, it is important to focus on the efficient use of resources by replacing commercially-available products with industrial by-products or waste materials. The concrete industry is the largest in the building sector, so the focus of reaching the targets mentioned above is in the daily scope for engineers and researchers. Reducing the costly and environmentally aggressive Portland cement and increasing concrete durability are the targets that act as guidelines for concrete development. Both issues have proven to be partially solved by incorporating supplementary cementitious materials, also known as pozzolans, in concrete composition. Following the American standard ASTM C125, the pozzolans contain siliceous and aluminous materials, which possess little or no cementitious value but will, in finely divided forms in the presence of moisture, react chemically with calcium hydroxide at ordinary temperatures to form compounds possessing cementitious properties. Pozzolans are usually introduced in the composition of concrete to reduce the amount of cement needed and improve its durability. Pozzolans reduce absorption, permeability and ion diffusivity by reducing the porosity of the binder due to the formation of a calcium silicate hydrate gel from the pozzolan and excess Ca(OH)2 coming from the Portland cement. The amount of pozzolans introduced varies, from 5 to 40 wt.% of the cement. The typical natural pozzolans are metakaolin , pumice and natural zeolites , while the most popular commercial material used as a pozzolan in the concrete industry is silica fume and fly ash [,]. Different waste-origin pozzolans are being intensively researched as alternatives to existing ones, and the most promising are calcined clay and glass waste, different types of ashes including coal bottom ash, which could reduce the total cement content by 20 wt.%, retaining the given strength class and also reducing concrete cost by 9%. The major concern regarding the use of waste glass as supplementary cementitious materials are alkali content. It is concluded that alkali content within glasses should be limited to a maximum of 4%. This is why in this research two types of glasses were evaluated regarding to its alkali content - low alkali glass (<4%) and high alkali content glass (>4%).The material of interest is:

Title:
A preliminary study of manufacture of cement from rice husk ash
Abstract:
Cement has been successfully produced from the agricultural waste, rice husk ash. For this production, rice husk was pre-carbonized in a pilot-plant and was further decarbonized in an electric furnace to produce rice husk ash. 24.5% rice husk ash was mixed with other raw materials (sourced locally) for producing white Portland cement and the cement produced was used to make a concrete slab. The formulated cement slab, commercial cement and slab were tested for their physical characteristics and chemical composition. The results of tests confirmed that produced cement was of similar standard to commercial cement. Based on the results, the production of cement from rice husk has been recommended for developing countries since it would help reduce problems of rice husks as farm wastes.The material of interest is:

Title:
Effect of chemical composition of slag on chloride penetration resistance of concrete
Abstract:
Three ground granulated slags (FeMn arc-furnace (GGAS), Corex (GGCS) and blastfurnace (GGBS) slags) of varying chemical composition, and from different sources were used to make concretes using two w/b ratios (0.40 and 0.60) and three slag replacement levels (20%, 35% and 50%). The effect of chemical composition and replacement level of slags on the chloride penetration resistance of the concretes was assessed using the chloride conductivity test. The results showed that the chloride penetration resistance of concrete increases with decreasing w/b ratio and increasing slag replacement level. In the GGAS concretes, despite having relatively low SiO2 and high MgO content, its significantly high Mn2O3 and low Al2O3 content was found to have a negative effect on the chloride penetration resistance of the concrete. The significantly high chloride penetration resistance of GGCS concretes was partly attributed to both its high CaO content and particle fineness. Only GGCS concretes showed a trend of increasing chloride penetration resistance with increased particle fineness; GGBS and GGAS concretes did not show any trend between particle fineness and chloride penetration resistance. The slag activity index was found to be a better indicator of chloride penetration resistance in concrete than the slag hydraulic index.The material of interest is:

Properties of geopolymer with seeded fly ash and rice husk bark ash
Abstract:
In the present work, compressive strength of inorganic polymers (geopolymers) produced of seeded fly ash and rice husk bark ash has been investigated. Different specimens made from a mixture of fly ash and rice husk bark ash in fine and coarse form were subjected to compressive strength tests at 7 and 28 days of curing. The curing regime was different: one set of the specimens were cured at room temperature until reaching to 7 and 28 days and the other sets were oven cured for 36h at the range of 40-90degC and then cured at room temperature until 7 and 28 days. The results indicate that in both 7 and 28 days regimes, the highest strengths are related to the specimens by SiO2/Al2O3 ratio equals 2.99 cured at 80degC. For these specimens, those contained finer fly ash particles show more compressive strength. Thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy both also are in agreement with the obtained results from compressive strength tests. In addition, SEM micrographs of the specimens show that the finer the particle size of the utilized ashes, the denser the microstructure which confirms the results obtained by the strength tests.The material of interest is:

Title:
Use of increasing amounts of bagasse ash waste to produce self-compacting concrete by adding limestone powder waste
Abstract:
Bagasse ash is an abundantly available combustion by-product in the sugarcane industry. We examined the effect of adding limestone powder to self-compacting concrete mixtures in which large amounts of bagasse ash were employed as a fine aggregate replacement. A Type 1 Portland cement content of 550kg/m3 was maintained in all of the mixtures. The fine aggregate was replaced with 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100% bagasse ash and limestone powder by volume. Mixtures were designed to yield a slump flow diameter of 70+-2.5cm. The workability (slump flow, T 50cm slump flow time, V-funnel flow time, and J-ring flow) and hardened properties (ultrasonic pulse velocity and compressive strength) of each mixture were measured, and blocking assessments were performed. The volumetric percentage replacement of 20% limestone powder in fine aggregate incorporating 20% bagasse ash effectively enhanced the workability and hardened properties of self-compacting concrete.The material of interest is:

Alkali-silica reactions (ASR) in alkali-activated slag (AAS) and Portland cement (PC) mortars were studied to compare their expansions and products. ASR expansions were measured following ASTM C1260 with modified curing and exposure conditions. Scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM/EDX) was used to characterize the ASR products in both types of mortar after 28 days of testing. The concentration of OH- in the extraction solution of all the mortars at different ages was determined by ex situ extraction method. The results showed that AAS mortars exhibited lower ASR expansion than the PC mortars when they were exposed to 1 N NaOH solution. The observation of ASR products in the AAS mortars under water and steam exposure conditions supported the presence of their minor ASR expansions, which were not observed in the corresponding PC mortars. SEM/EDX observation and analyses demonstrated obviously different morphologies of AAS mortars under different exposure conditions. The lower ASR expansion of mortars can be explained by their lower concentration of OH- in the extraction solution, which might reflect the relative alkalinity in their pore solution.The material of interest is:

Title:
Experimental characterization of binary and ternary blended-cement concretes containing ultrafine residual rice husk and sugar cane bagasse ashes
Abstract:
AbstractIn the present work an experimental program was carried out to investigate the influence of residual sugar cane bagasse and rice husk ashes (SCBA and RHA, respectively) in the properties of concretes. SCBA and RHA were produced using vibratory grinding in dry open circuit and conventional and high-performance concretes were produced with 0% and 20% of both ashes as cement replacement (by mass). Ternary mixtures containing cement, SCBA and RHA (0.6â€“0.2â€“0.2) were also produced in order to study the benefits of the simultaneous use of both ultrafine ashes on concrete properties. Experiments were performed to investigate the rheology (yield stress and plastic viscosity), compressive strength (at 7, 28, 90, and 180days), Youngâ€™s modulus (at 28days) and rapid chloride-ion penetrability. The pore size distribution and adiabatic temperature rise of the reference and ternary mixtures were also evaluated. The joint influence of both ashes allowed reaching positive effects in rheology and kept constant or increased the compressive strength when compared to the reference mixtures. Moreover, the ternary concretes presented lower electric charges and the replacement of cement by 40% SCBA and RHA decreased significantly the maximum adiabatic temperature rise of conventional concrete.The material of interest is:

Title:
Geopolymerisation of silt generated from construction and demolition waste washing plants
Abstract:
Recycling plants that size, sort and wash construction and demolition waste can produce high quality aggregate. However, they also produce up to 80 ton per hour of filter cake waste containing fine (<63 mm) silt particles that is classified as inert waste and normally landfilled. This research investigated the potential to form geopolymers containing silt, which would allow this problematic waste to be beneficially reused as aggregate. This would significantly improve the economic viability of recycling plants that wash wastes. Silt filter cakes have been collected from a number of aggregate washing plants operating in the UK. These were found to contain similar aluminosilicate crystalline phases. Geopolymer samples were produced using silt and silt mixed with either metakaolin or pulverised fuel ash (PFA). Silt geopolymers cured at room temperature had average 7-day compressive strengths of 18.7 MPa, while partial substitution of silt by metakaolin or PFA increased average compressive strengths to 30.5 and 21.9 MPa, respectively. Curing specimens for 24 h at 105 degC resulted in a compressive strength of 39.7 MPa and microstructural analysis confirmed the formation of dense materials. These strengths are in excess of those required for materials to be used as aggregate, particularly in unbound applications. The implications of this research for the management of waste silt at construction and demolition waste washing plants are discussed.The material of interest is:

Title:
Production of supplementary cementitious material as a sustainable management strategy for water treatment sludge waste
Abstract:
This paper investigates the application of Water Treatment Sludge (WTS), the main waste generated by water potabilization activities, for the development of a Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM). The waste has been processed by calcining at a temperature range of 600 degC-800 degC for one hour. Chemical, mineralogical, physical, and morphological characterization has been performed to identify the potential pozzolanic activity of the calcined WTS and validate the application as SCM. Compressive strength tests have been performed in cement mortars with 14%, 35%, and 50% replacement of Portland cement by WTS. The WTS is a non-hazardous and non-inert waste, composed of SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and contains essentially quartz and kaolinite. Results confirmed the transformation of kaolinite into reactive amorphous phase by calcining. WTS calcined at 600 degC shows great potential to the production of SCM, confirmed by the chemical and physical analysis and the evidence of pozzolanic activity. The mechanical properties of mortars produced with 14% and 35% WTS calcined at 600 degC suggests a promising application in the production of blended and pozzolanic Portland cement.The material of interest is:
